Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into \u00bd\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\nCombine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and \u00bd tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\nAdd bread, apples, oil, and \u00bc tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\nPlace onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\nPlace a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F, 50\u201360 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165\u00b0F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\nMeanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\nUsing your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\nSet reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about \u00bc cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\nServe chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.",

Add vegetables and bread to sausage.\nWhisk together eggs, \u00bd cup cream, turkey stock, cheese, and parsley, then stir into stuffing and cool completely, about 30 minutes. Reserve 5 cups stuffing to stuff turkey and spoon remainder into baking dish, then drizzle with remaining \u00bc cup cream. Cover stuffing and chill.\nAbout 1 hour before stuffed turkey is finished roasting, bring dish of stuffing to room temperature. When turkey is done, increase oven temperature to 425\u00b0F and bake stuffing, covered tightly with foil, until hot throughout, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until top is golden and crisp, about 15 minutes more.\nCooks' Note: Bread can be toasted 3 days ahead and kept (once cool) in a sealed bag at room temperature. Stuffing can be prepared (but not baked) 4 hours before roasting turkey. If baking stuffing at the same time as potatoes, put stuffing in upper third of oven and potatoes in bottom third (allow extra time).",

            "instructions_full": "Combine dals, rice, and barley in a medium bowl. Pour in water to cover and swish dals and grains around with your fingers. Drain and repeat process until water runs clear enough to see your hands through. Pour in water to cover and let dals and grains soak at room temperature at least 2 hours, or cover and chill up to 12 hours.\nPlace lamb on a plate, pat dry with paper towels, and season all over with 2 tsp. salt; set aside. Peel ginger by scraping off skin with a spoon. Finely grate half of ginger; set aside. Thinly slice remaining ginger. Stack slices and cut crosswise into matchsticks; set aside.\nIf using an electric pressure cooker, combine shallots and ghee in pot and set to saut\u00e9 function or high. Cook, stirring often and adjusting heat as needed if your cooker has that option, until shallots are just beginning to brown, about 8 minutes (or about 6 minutes if cooking in oil). Reduce to normal function or medium if possible, or, if your cooker doesn\u2019t have a lower setting, turn off for a minute if mixture is getting too hot. Add reserved ginger matchsticks and cook, stirring often, until shallots are brown and crisp and ginger is frizzled, 4\u201310 minutes, depending on your cooker. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots and ginger to a plate, spreading out into a single layer. Season lightly with salt; let cool.\nAdd garlic, garam masala, cayenne, turmeric, and reserved grated ginger, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lamb and stir to coat in spices. Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon and repeatedly adding splashes of water as spices begin to stick to bottom of pot and scraping up browned bits, until flavors come together, about 15 minutes.(Bhuna, the process of repeated sticking and scraping, is a Southeast Asian cooking technique that brings out the flavor of the spices and ensures they don\u2019t taste raw and grainy.)\nDrain dal mixture and add to pot along with 1 tsp. salt and 5 cups water. Secure lid and bring to full pressure according to manufacturer\u2019s directions. Cook 1\u00bd hours. Let sit 20 minutes, then manually release pressure and open up.\nTaste haleem and add more salt and cayenne if needed. Add chiles if using. (These are for flavor, not heat; feel free to leave them out.) Simmer on normal function or medium, stirring often, 5 minutes. Stir in \u00bd cup cilantro.\nServe haleem with white onion, lime wedges, reserved crispy shallots and ginger, and more chopped cilantro.\nIf using a medium Dutch oven or stovetop pressure cooker, cook shallots and ghee over high heat, stirring often, until shallots are just beginning to brown, about 8 minutes (or about 6 minutes if cooking in oil). Add reserved ginger matchsticks and cook, stirring often, until shallots are brown and crisp and ginger is frizzled, 5\u20138 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots and ginger to a plate, spreading out in a single layer. Season lightly with salt; let cool.\nReduce heat to medium, add garlic, garam masala, cayenne, turmeric, and reserved grated ginger, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon and repeatedly adding splashes of water as spices begin to stick to bottom of pot and scraping up browned bits, until flavors come together, about 15 minutes. (Bhuna, the process of repeated sticking and scraping, is a Southeast Asian cooking technique that brings out the flavor of the spices and ensures they don\u2019t taste raw and grainy.)\nDrain dal mixture and add to pot along with 1 tsp. salt and 6\u00bd cups water (if using a Dutch oven) or 5 cups water (for pressure cooker). Increase heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to the low, cover pot, and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot every 15\u201320 minutes, until meat is falling off the bone and dals and grains have nearly melted into the stew, 4\u00bd\u20135 hours. (If using a stovetop cooker, increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Secure lid and bring to full pressure according to manufacturer\u2019s directions. Cook 1\u00bd hours. Let sit 20 minutes, then manually release pressure and open up.)\nTaste haleem and add more salt and cayenne if needed. Add chiles if using. (These are for flavor, not heat; feel free to leave them out.) Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, 5 minutes. Stir in \u00bd cup cilantro.\nServe haleem with white onion, lime wedges, reserved crispy shallots and ginger, and more chopped cilantro.\nDo ahead: Haleem can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat over medium until warmed through.",

Aleppo pepper (or \u215b tsp. crushed red pepper flakes), and 2 Tbsp. tomato paste. Cook and stir constantly until the onions are coated and the tomato paste has darkened slightly, about 2 minutes.

Turn off the heat and season with salt, pepper, and more Aleppo pepper or red pepper flakes to taste.\nUsing a spoon, create 3 wells in the lentil mixture. Carefully crack 1 egg into each well. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the whites of the eggs are just set, 11 to 13 minutes.\nWhile the eggs bake, in a small pot or butter warmer, heat 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, ghee, or olive oil over medium heat. Add \u00bd tsp. cumin seeds; swirl the pan until the seeds start to sizzle and brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from the heat.\nDrizzle the finished eggs with the butter mixture, season with salt and pepper, and garnish with parsley before serving.",

Holding the blunt side of the knife with both hands, press and scrape the knife\u2019s sharp end, holding it at a slight angle, across the garlic mound to flatten it. Repeat, dragging it across the garlic, until you have a smooth paste. Set aside.\nIn a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and 1\u00bd tsp. of the evaporated milk into a slurry. Pour the rest of the evaporated milk into a medium saucepan and stir in the slurry. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly. Turn the heat to low and add the Cheddar gradually by the handful, stirring until the Cheddar is melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the cream cheese and whisk until it melts. Stir in the mayonnaise, pimento peppers, 1\u00bd tsp. of the chipotle pur\u00e9e, and the garlic paste. Season with salt. Transfer to a serving bowl or keep it warm in a slow cooker and serve immediately.\nTo reheat the sauce, microwave it, stirring every 30 seconds, until fully melted.",

Whisk anchovies, garlic, 3 Tbsp. mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. mustard, 1 Tbsp. oil, and 1\u00bd tsp. pepper in a small bowl. Set aside 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo in another small bowl.\nPat chicken dry; season outside and inside all over with salt. Arrange breast side up in a cast-iron skillet and tuck wings underneath. Arrange shallots around (if using legs, nestle under and around); season with salt and pepper. Brush remaining anchovy mayo all over chicken, making sure to get it into the nooks and crannies, then brush shallots with any leftover anchovy mayo.\nPlace chicken in oven so legs are facing toward the back (this is the hottest part of the oven and will help the legs cook before the breast dries out) and roast until some anchovy mayo and fat begin to drip onto shallots, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using tongs, turn shallots to coat in drippings. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast chicken, stirring shallots once or twice, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F, 45\u201355 minutes. If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160\u00b0F). Transfer chicken and shallots to a cutting board, leaving behind any juices and fat in skillet. If shallots need more time to soften and darken, roast a bit longer without chicken before proceeding. Reserve skillet.\nReduce oven temperature to 400\u00b0F. Finely grate half of zest of 1 lemon into a large bowl; cut lemon in half and squeeze in juice. Add reserved 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo, remaining 3 Tbsp. mayo, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and whisk to combine, then stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper.

Add leeks and half of lemon zest, season with salt and pepper, and mix to coat leeks in butter. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are somewhat tender, about 5 minutes. Remove lid, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and just starting to take on color, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes, then add broth, scraping up any browned bits. Tuck short sides of each chicken thigh underneath so they are touching and nestle seam side down into rice mixture. Bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Cut remaining 1 Tbsp. butter into small pieces and scatter over mixture. Re-cover and let sit 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, pulse anchovy, garlic, capers, a few pinches of red pepper flakes, and remaining lemon zest in a food processor until finely chopped. Add herbs; process until a paste forms. With motor running, gradually stream in oil until loosened to a thick sauce. Add half of lemon juice; season salsa verde with salt.\nDrizzle remaining lemon juice over chicken and rice. Serve with salsa verde.",

Cover, remove from heat, and let sit, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes to allow chiles to soften. Transfer to a blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth; set aside.\nPlace rack in lowest position in oven; preheat to 500\u00b0F. Brush a rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp. lard. Divide dough into 4 pieces and form into balls. Set on work surface and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Place 1 ball between 2 sheets of parchment or wax paper. Using a small skillet or saucepan, gently press ball into a 5\"-diameter disk. Carefully peel away parchment; place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining balls.\nBake gorditas until outer edges are lightly golden, 10\u201312 minutes. Turn over and bake until golden brown and crisp, 10\u201312 minutes. Transfer to plates and let cool 10 minutes. Insert a paring knife into side of gordita and, using a slow sawing motion, cut open along one side (keep other side intact).\nHeat remaining 2 Tbsp. lard in a large skillet over high. Cook shrimp until lightly browned and just cooked through, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a medium bowl. Reduce heat to medium and cook garlic in same skillet, tossing often, until beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add thyme sprigs, vinegar, agave, 1\u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, and reserved chile pur\u00e9e. Cook, stirring occasionally, until brick red and the consistency of a thick sauce, 6\u20138 minutes. Add shrimp and any juices and cook 1 minute. Remove from heat; add butter and stir constantly until melted and sauce is glossy. Season with more salt if needed. Remove and discard thyme.\nFill gorditas with shrimp mixture, onion, avocado, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.",

Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Toss potatoes, shallots, and 2 tsp. salt in a large bowl.\nMelt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until butter foams, then browns, 5\u20138 minutes. Immediately remove from heat (it will continue to darken) and stir in cream, garlic, pepper, nutmeg, and remaining 1\u00bd tsp. salt. Set saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring, until salt is dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch. Stir in thyme and sage; remove from heat.\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in a large stainless-steel skillet over medium-high until melted and bubbling. Working in 2 batches, cook chicken, skin side down, until golden underneath, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a 13x9\" or 3-qt. baking dish and arrange skin side up. Set skillet with pan drippings aside. Nestle potatoes and shallots around chicken (don\u2019t place on top). Pour brown butter cream over chicken and vegetables, making sure herbs and spices are evenly dispersed and tucking herbs into vegetables so they don\u2019t get too crispy when they bake.\nBake gratin until cream is mostly reduced and chicken and vegetables are dark golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let gratin cool 5\u201310 minutes.\nMeanwhile, pulse bread in a food processor until pieces are about oat-size (you should have about 1\u00bc cups). Toss breadcrumbs in pan drippings in reserved skillet to coat. Cook over medium heat, scraping up browned bits with a spatula, until deep golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes. Let cool.\nTo serve, top gratin with breadcrumbs. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing over if desired.",

            "instructions_full": "Place the zest strips in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and \u00be teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months.\nDrain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the side of the blender as needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. The puree can be made a couple of days ahead. (Makes about 1 cup.)\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl.\nIn a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl.\nPour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about \u00bd cup.)\nUsing a sharp knife, cut the peel and pith off the orange. Working over a bowl, cut the orange between the membranes to release the segments. Dice the segments, then return them to the bowl.\nDrizzle the beet wedges with a little bit of olive oil, season with salt, and toss.\nSpread the ginger puree on the bottom of a shallow serving bowl or plate. Arrange the beets over the puree. Sprinkle the chopped orange segments over the beets and grind some pepper over the dish. Top with the cashews, herbs, and sunchoke chips. Serve.",

Butter a 9-inch nonstick metal cake pan with some ghee.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the paneer, confectioners\u2019 sugar, and cardamom until incorporated but still slightly chunky. Add the semolina, ghee, and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cashews and raisins and set aside.\nSprinkle the granulated sugar over the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and once the sugar just begins to bubble and turn pale golden brown (the sugar will continue to caramelize in the oven, so don\u2019t let it get any darker right now), after 8 to 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat using tongs. (This step is a bit tricky and you might be tempted to move the sugar around with a spoon while it is bubbling, but don\u2019t touch it\u2014just let it caramelize on its own.) You will know it\u2019s ready for the cake batter when it\u2019s bubbling but is still slightly grainy and just turning a pale golden color. Pour the batter into the pan, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean. It should settle into an even layer on its own, but if it doesn\u2019t, use the spatula to create a smooth surface.\nWearing oven mitts, carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cake\u2019s edges and then place a serving platter larger than the diameter of the cake over the cake and gently flip the cake over\u2014it should slide out, with caramel coming out with it like you would see in a flan (though some caramel will be left in the pan\u2014this is fine).\nSlice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nNote: To clean the pan, add some boiling water to the pan and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to loosen up the browned sugar sticking to the surface of the pan before cleaning it.",

            "instructions_full": "In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to 195\u00b0F over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature.\nRemove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but don\u2019t fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Don\u2019t panic if this hasn\u2019t happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. This should do the trick.\nLine a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon, then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this point the paneer is ready to use or it can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 3 days.",

Blitz till it\u2019s as smooth as your blender allows.\nIn an ovenproof 12-inch saut\u00e9 pan or skillet set over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the minced garlic. Watch for the garlic to start sizzling, then stir in the spinach and \u00bd teaspoon of the salt. Continue stirring for a minute, until all the spinach is wilted. Remove it from the pan and set aside.\nAdd the final tablespoon olive oil to the pan, raise the heat to medium, and add the turkey plus 1 teaspoon salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, break the turkey up into small morsels as it browns. When you have browned turkey, add the cumin, paprika, and black pepper. Stir to incorporate, toasting the spices for about 30 seconds.\nAdd the carrot-tomato mixture, the R-Rated Onions, vinegar, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Let this cook for about 15 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. You may need to lower the heat to prevent Joe from sticking or splattering. When the ragout is done it will be thick and juicy. If it seems too dry, stir in a little water. Taste the ragout for seasoning and adjust as you like.\nTurn the heat off and make four indentions in the ragout. Divide the spinach and put equal amounts in each indentation. Top each section of spinach with a cracked egg. Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.\nSlide the skillet onto the middle rack of your preheated oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks are slightly runny.\nTo serve, scatter ribbons of Parmigiano Reggiano or another hard cheese over the top. If bread is your thing, this is great with toast.",

Slice them thinly with the grain, following the line from root to stem rather than cutting the onion across its belly. This is actually important because slicing it the other way makes the path to silky onions a longer one.\nOnce your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula and watch as they wilt for about 3 more minutes. At this point, reduce the heat to medium low. Put a lid on and step away for a few minutes. Give the onions a stir every now and then. You don\u2019t have to stand over it like risotto, but don\u2019t go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and that\u2019s good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but don\u2019t rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized\nAbout 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a \u00bd cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course. When you\u2019re smiling over a soft, creamy, fragrant pile of mahogany onions, you\u2019re done.\nNote: R-Rated Onions will keep in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for 3 months.",

(Alternatively, you can let broth cool slightly, then pur\u00e9e with sqush and miso in a regular blender.)\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and cook broccolini until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a plate.\nAdd noodles to same pot and cook according to packet directions. Drain and divide noodles among bowls.\nLadle broth over noodles and arrange broccolini and reserved squash (cut in half if they are very big) on top. Scatter cilantro over.",

            "instructions_full": "If using dried peas, soak them overnight in 3 cups of water. Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside. Wash the rice by placing it in a colander or fine-mesh sieve and running cold water over it until the water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain well and set aside.\nHeat the oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or other heavy, deep pot. Add the sugar and swirl in the pot, stirring constantly; allow it to caramelize to a dark brown color. Add the chicken and stir well to coat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.\nStir in 2 cups of water, the coconut milk, bay leaf, Green Seasoning, parsley, thyme, carrots, and scallions. Season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.\nStir the rice, squash, peas, hot pepper, ketchup, and butter into the chicken. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until the peas and vegetables are tender. Remove lid and fluff the rice. The rice should be moist but not sticky. Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and hot pepper.\nNote: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or \"cheese\" pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute. Butternut squash will also work, although it will be slightly less sweet.",

            "instructions_full": "Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won\u2019t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.\nDecrease the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don\u2019t panic\u2014it\u2019ll still be delicious, and you\u2019ll do better next time!\nLet the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don\u2019t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you\u2019re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you\u2019ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.\nIn a large heavy-bottomed saut\u00e9 pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",

            "instructions_full": "Whisk milk powder, baking powder, granulated sugar, and 2 cups (240 g) flour in a large shallow bowl. Add about a fourth of \u00be cup warm water (110\u00b0) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.)\nDrizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.\nRoll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6\"\u2013diameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a \u00be\" interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you don\u2019t need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.\nHeat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place a ball of dough on a dimpled side on a lightly floured surface. Gently flatten into a round with your hands, turning once if desired, then roll, rotating often, to a \u215b\"-thick round, about 10\u201312\".\nBrush tawa with a thin layer of oil. Cook roti until it begins to bubble slightly across the surface, about 20 seconds. Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; that\u2019s okay). Using a spatula, move roti around to avoid hot spots and ensure even cooking, pressing on edges and uncooked spots to increase contact with pan. Continue to cook, turning every 30 seconds or so, until cooked through and both sides are speckled with golden brown spots, 1\u20132 minutes more. Using 2 spatulas, push opposite edges of roti toward the center. Smack down on the bunched roti with the ends of the spatulas to break up and flake, then turn roti over. Repeat process, scrunching and smacking roti from different directions, until flaky and lightly shredded. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel set inside a bowl or basket and wrap up to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough balls and more oil, adding finished roti to bowl and covering tightly with towel as you go.",

Set aside for 2 hours.\nIn a large saucepan, combine mango mixture and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until mangoes are softened.\nHave a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add red chiles and curry leaves and cook for 15\u201320 seconds. Add the tempered spice mixture to the saucepan and stir to combine.\nGarnish with fried onions (if using). Serve with rice.\nTempering is a traditional method of extracting optimal flavor from Indian spices, and it is a skill learned with practice! Reducing the heat a little before adding the spices prevents the spices from burning and adding a bitterness to your dish. If they do burn, simply start again with fresh spices.",

Add \u00bc cup of the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, then 1 cup milk, and then 1 Tbsp. of the butter, blending for 30 seconds after each addition. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, \u00bc tsp. allspice, \u00bc tsp. ground ginger, \u00bc tsp. nutmeg, \u00bd tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. of the cinnamon in one addition. Blend again until combined and frothy, 1 minute (scraping down the sides of the blender if necessary).\nPull the hot pan from the oven and add the remaining 2 Tbsp. butter, swirling the pan so it melts evenly across the bottom (it will bubble and brown). Once the butter is melted, immediately pour in the Dutch baby batter and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown and slightly puffed, 20 minutes.\nWhile the Dutch baby bakes, combine \u00bd cup apple cider, 3 Tbsp. maple syrup, the remaining \u00bd tsp. cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and the rest of the can of pumpkin pur\u00e9e (about 1 \u00bc cups) in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture starts to bubble, then reduce to medium and cook, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides of the pot with a spatula, until dark and thickened with no raw pumpkin flavor remaining, 20 to 25 minutes. Slice the Dutch baby (it will start to sink as soon as you take it out of the oven) and serve with the pumpkin butter and powdered sugar.",

Season chicken legs all over with 3 tsp. salt.\nSwirl 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to coat and heat over medium-high. Place 2 chicken legs, skin side down, in pot, making sure skin is in direct contact with pan. Cook, undisturbed, until dark golden, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken legs; reserve pot.\nMeanwhile, working one at a time, stand a bulb, root end down, on a cutting board and slice off a short end to create a flat surface. Turn cut side down and slice \u00bd\" thick, starting from the top end of bulb so the root end can hold the layers in place while you slice. Discard last \u00bc\" (root end) of each bulb and pop out and discard tougher center from slices. Transfer fennel to a large bowl and add half of the grapes, \u00bd tsp. salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; toss to coat. Set aside.\nReduce heat to medium and combine broth, honey, chile paste, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in reserved pot. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. Place remaining grapes in pot and arrange chicken legs, skin side up and overlapping if needed, over grapes. Top with dressed fennel and grapes. (Don\u2019t worry if it looks crowded: Fennel will soften as it cooks.)\nTransfer pot, uncovered, to oven and roast until fennel is slightly softened, with some crispy, caramelized edges, grapes on top are swollen and browned in spots, and chicken is cooked through, 30\u201340 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.\nUsing a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer grapes and fennel to a bowl and chicken to a platter. Place pot over medium-high heat and bring braising liquid to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half (you should have about 1 cup liquid), 8\u201310 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar and fennel fronds.\nSpoon sauce over chicken and serve with fennel and grapes alongside.",

            "instructions_full": "Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes.\nReserve \u00bd cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil.\nIf you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you\u2019re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.\nWith your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining \u00bd cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.\nFlour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.\nLightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.\nAfter 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.\nRepeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it\u2019s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it\u2019s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.\nWipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don\u2019t deflate all the air inside.\nLightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of \u201ccage\u201d around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.\nSpace the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn\u2019t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they\u2019re pillowy.\nMeanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You\u2019re emulating a 700\u00b0F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.\nWhen the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don\u2019t manhandle it or you\u2019ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.\nWith firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it\u2019s about 6 inches across.\nThis next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions\u2014screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you\u2019re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don\u2019t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it\u2014 it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it\u2019s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.\nUse tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.\nBake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature.",

            "instructions_full": "To make the \u201cbeet water,\u201d roughly chop 2 pounds of the beets (select the smaller ones), preferably in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.\nPlace the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.\nStrain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.\nMeanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.\nWhen the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.\nTo make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into \u00bd-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.\nTo cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.\nTo compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the \u201cbeet water\u201d and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.",

Season fillets on both sides with salt and alligator pepper.\nToast cubeb peppers in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Let cool and coarsely grind; set aside. Coarsely chop half of papaya into 1\" pieces; set remaining half aside. Coarsely chop half of cilantro (leaves and stems); set remaining cilantro aside.\nTransfer chopped papaya to a blender; add oil and blend, adding 1\u20132 Tbsp. water to get it going if needed, until smooth. Add chopped cilantro, onion, garlic, ginger, ground chile, \u00bc tsp. salt, and reserved ground cubeb pepper. Blend mixture to a smooth paste.\nCoat fillets all over with marinade, rubbing into score marks. Place fish, skin side down, in a single layer in a large baking dish. Squeeze juice from half a lemon over. Set remaining lemon half aside for serving. Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.\nFill a large bowl with water. Peel yams and slice in half lengthwise, then slice in half crosswise. Cut each quarter into \u00bd\"-thick slabs. (Length of slabs will depend on yam\u2019s size, but you\u2019re going for something that looks like steak fries.) Add yam slices to bowl as you work to prevent oxidation. When all yams are cut, swish in water to remove excess starch, then drain. Refill bowl and repeat process until water is clear, about 2 more times. Add sugar and \u00bd tsp. salt and stir until dissolved; add the drained chips. (Yams, like many foods that are good for you, can be quite bitter; the sugar will help counter this.) Let soak 30 minutes.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0. Drain chips and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Season with black pepper, then sprinkle with chili powder and remaining 1 tsp. salt. Toss to coat, then spread out into an even layer. Roast chips, turning halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.\nHeat broiler. Scrape off excess marinade from fish and place fillets, skin side up, on another rimmed baking sheet. Broil until browned and crisp on top and cooked through, 5\u20137 minutes.\nUsing a vegetable peeler, shave reserved papaya into ribbons, pick leaves from reserved cilantro stems, and cut reserved lemon half into wedges.\nTransfer fish to plates and top with papaya and cilantro. Mound yam chips next to fillets. Serve with shito and lemon wedges alongside.",

            "instructions_full": "Place apricots in a small bowl and pour in hot water to cover. Let sit 20 minutes, then drain and coarsely chop. Return apricots to same bowl and add rum; stir to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Drain into a mesh sieve set over another small bowl or container. Reserve apricots and rum separately.\nMelt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, 3 Tbsp. coconut sugar, and reserved apricots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apricots are slightly softened and coated in caramel, 6\u20138 minutes. Add reserved rum and cook, stirring often, until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. (Just FYI: You can eat these drunk apricots right away over vanilla ice cream and be very happy.)\nToast grains of selim pods and cubeb peppers in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Grind as well as you can. The grains of selim won\u2019t completely break up, so cracked open but mostly whole is okay\u2014you just want to release some of their flavor.\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook white and red onions, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting brown, 20\u201325 minutes. Stir in ground grains of selim and cubeb pepper, garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 tsp. coconut sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, rosemary, thyme, prawn powder, and 1 tsp. salt to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add drunk apricots along with any syrup and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes.\nAdd tomato pur\u00e9e to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes, then stir in chile powder. Add broth and fresh chile. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until a loose dark brown paste forms, 30\u201340 minutes. The oil will rise to the surface when the sauce is ready. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt if needed. If you like texture, leave as is, or blend with an immersion blender (or let it cool slightly and blend it in a blender) to make it smooth. Let cool completely.\nSpoon shito into jars or an airtight container with at least a \u00bc\" layer of oil on top.\nDo ahead: Shito can made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.\nNote: The amount of chile described in this recipe is what I would classify as pretty hot\u2014some West Africans might call this medium hot, some very hot. Folks familiar with heat will enjoy this, but if you don\u2019t like super-jacked heat you should probably err on the lower end of the range.

            "instructions_full": "Combine the dried beans and kombu in a large container and cover with plenty of water to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight; skip this step if using fresh beans.\nDrain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.\nRemove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.\nSet up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.\nIn a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Pur\u00e9e until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you\u2019re ready to serve.\nWhile the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Cut the bacon into \u00bc in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.\nIn a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.\nIncrease the heat slightly, and saut\u00e9 the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.\nThinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.\nTo serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it\u2019s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.\nThis works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you\u2019re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don\u2019t have an airlock, you\u2019ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely.",

Roast for 40 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the squash, until tender when pierced with a small knife.\nPlace the squash on a serving platter. If the halves are too large for one serving, cut each piece in half through the stem. Drizzle lightly with extra maple syrup, sprinkle with sea salt, and serve hot.\nAcorn squash is hard to cut. To halve a whole squash, plunge the blade of a large chef\u2019s knife into the side of the squash as far as it will go.

Drizzle with oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast until tomatoes begin to look dry on top, 25\u201330 minutes. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, cook garlic and butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling often, until butter foams and milk solids turn golden, 5\u20137 minutes. Strain garlic butter through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring cup; transfer garlic and toasty bits to a cutting board. Finely chop and set aside.\nReduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F. Pulse crackers and \u00bc tsp. salt in a food processor until fine crumbs form (you should have about 2 cups). Add eggs and 6 Tbsp. garlic butter and pulse until mixture is the consistency of wet sand; set remaining garlic butter aside. Transfer to springform pan. Using a flat-bottomed measuring cup, press crumbs firmly onto bottom and 1\u00bd\" up sides of pan. Bake crust until edge is just starting to take on color, 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let crust cool.\nMix Taleggio, Parmesan, mayonnaise, chopped thyme, remaining \u00bd tsp. salt, remaining \u00bc tsp. pepper, and reserved chopped garlic in a medium bowl. Gently dollop half of cheese mixture over bottom of crust, then spread into an even layer with an offset spatula (don\u2019t press too hard or you will break the crust). Layer half of tomato slices over and press down to even out layers. Repeat with remaining cheese mixture and tomatoes. Brush remaining garlic butter over tomatoes. Top with shallot and thyme leaves.\nSet pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake pie until filling is bubbling vigorously and crust is browned, 60\u201375 minutes. Transfer to rack and let cool 1 hour before serving.\nDo Ahead: Pie can be made 1 day ahead. Cover loosely and chill.",

Using a mortar and pestle or the side of a chef\u2019s knife, coarsely crush coriander seeds and add to vegetables along with cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, chile powder and turmeric; set aside.\nHeat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Arrange paneer in a single layer in pan and cook until golden brown underneath, about 1 minute. (If paneer is sticking, just give cheese a little more time to brown. It will release from pan once it is sufficiently crisped.) Using a slotted spatula or spoon, transfer paneer to a plate, leaving as much oil behind in pan as possible. Turn browned side up and season generously with salt.\nReduce heat to medium and add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to same skillet. Cook reserved scallion mixture, stirring often, until scallions are wilted and mustard seeds begin to pop, about 2 minutes.\nAdd tomatoes, sugar snap peas, and 1 cup water to skillet and season with salt. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Gently smash each tomato open with a spatula (you just want to break them open a little) and simmer until tomato juices thicken slightly, about 3 minutes (it should still be pretty brothy and light). Taste sauce and add more salt if needed. If your tomatoes aren\u2019t super sweet, you may need to add a pinch of sugar at this point to balance their acidity. Add paneer back to pan and simmer until warmed through.\nRemove pan from heat and toss in mint. Serve with cooked rice.",

Transfer chicken to a medium bowl; discard poaching liquid. Let chicken sit until cool enough to handle, then shred meat into big pieces; set aside.\nMeanwhile, place scallions in a small bowl and pour in very cold water to cover; let soak 10 minutes.\nDrain scallions in a mesh sieve or colander, then rinse under cold running water, swishing vigorously to rinse and to encourage them to curl up. Shake off as much water as possible and place in a large bowl; set aside.\nWorking one at a time, slice cucumbers in half crosswise, then slice each piece in half lengthwise. Place quarters cut side down and slice in half lengthwise again to create 8 pieces total per cucumber. Add to bowl with reserved chicken.\nSet 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds aside in a small bowl for serving. Crush remaining sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle until some of the seeds have turned to powder, but with plenty of whole seeds left. (Alternatively, you can pulse seeds a few times in a food processor or spice mill, then transfer to a medium bowl before proceeding). Add lime juice, tahini, soy sauce, honey, and red pepper flakes and mash to create a paste. Add \u00bc cup water and whisk to combine (if you don\u2019t have a small enough whisk, work in with the pestle). Taste and season with salt.\nAdd lettuce and cilantro to bowl with reserved scallions. Pour half of dressing over and toss to coat. Arrange on a platter. Pour remaining dressing over chicken and cucumbers, toss to coat, and arrange over greens. Top salad with reserved 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds and squeeze juice from lime half over.",

Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of pan, until slightly darkened, about 3 minutes. Add maple syrup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and Sriracha. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have come together, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Transfer about half of barbecue sauce to a heatproof bowl and set aside for serving.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate. Season chicken generously with salt. Grill chicken over direct heat, turning every minute, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Move chicken over indirect heat. Cover, positioning vent (if your grill has one) over chicken, and continue to grill, keeping grill covered as much as possible and turning every 5 minutes or so, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 140\u00b0F\u2013145\u00b0F, 18\u201325 minutes depending on the size of the pieces. Baste chicken with barbecue sauce and grill, turning and basting occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 160\u00b0F for breast and 165\u00b0F for dark meat, about 10 minutes longer.\nArrange chicken on a platter. Serve with reserved barbecue sauce alongside.\nDo Ahead: Barbecue sauce can be made 2 weeks ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill.",

Add dried currants and cook, stirring often, until plump, about 1 minute. Scrape nut mixture into a small bowl; season with salt.\nWipe out skillet and heat over medium-high. Stir together cumin, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Place lamb in pan and use a sturdy spatula to aggressively flatten (like you\u2019re making smash burgers); sprinkle spice mixture over. Cook, undisturbed, until lamb is well browned and crisp underneath, about 4 minutes. Hold back meat and drain off all of the fat. Break up meat into small pieces and mix in reserved nut mixture. Finely grate in remaining 2 garlic cloves and add reserved chopped dill. Cook, stirring, until herbs are wilted, about 1 minute. Set aside until pasta is ready.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until 1 minute shy of al dente (pasta will finish cooking in the sauce). Drain pasta and return to pot.\nPour reserved pur\u00e9e over pasta and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens enough to cling to pasta and just comes to a simmer, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; finely grate zest from lemon half over pasta, then squeeze in juice. Season with salt.\nDivide pasta among bowls and top with lamb mixture.",

Cook, undisturbed, until water is evaporated and rice is tender, 18\u201320 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, still covered, 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, trim dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside. Thinly slice white and pale green parts of scallions of a deep diagonal. Set aside separately.\nMix ginger and 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Add cod and season with salt and sprinkle all over with pepper. Toss to coat.\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook cod, undisturbed, until golden underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and scatter reserved white and pale green scallion parts on top. Cook, shaking the pan a few times, until fish is cooked through and some scallions are caramelized and some are just slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nStir vinegar and sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves. Mix into rice. Add butter and reserved dark green scallion tops and gently stir until butter is melted. Season with salt.\nTransfer rice to a platter and top with fish; pour any pan juices over.",

Add remaining salmon and pulse until pieces are no bigger than \u00bc,\" 4\u20135 times (be careful not to make it too smooth). Transfer to a large bowl.\nRemove dark green tops from scallions and finely chop. Thinly slice white and pale green parts and set aside. Add chopped scallion greens, ginger, garlic, 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise, and 1 tsp. salt to salmon and gently mix to combine. Form mixture into 4 patties about \u00be\" thick. Transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour or up to 3 hours.\nMeanwhile, mix sesame oil, 1 tsp. vinegar, remaining \u2154 cup mayonnaise, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl; set aside.\nToss cucumbers with a pinch of salt in another small bowl. Massage with your hands for a few minutes to soften and expel liquid; discard liquid. Add chile, sugar, and 2 tsp. vinegar and toss to coat. Cover and chill pickles until ready to assemble burgers.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Remove salmon patties from refrigerator and sprinkle with flour just to coat the outside (you won\u2019t need all of it). The patties will be a little loose but you can always pat them back together with your hands before they hit the pan. Working in batches and adding more oil in between batches if needed, cook patties until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side (watch carefully; you don\u2019t want to overcook).\nToss herbs, watercress, sesame seeds (if using), reserved white and pale green parts of scallions, remaining 1 tsp. vinegar, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Build burgers with buns, patties, herb mixture, pickles, and reserved sauce.",

Cover, remove from heat, and let sit 30 minutes to allow chiles to soften.\nPlace fish in a large bowl or baking dish. Transfer chile mixture and soaking liquid to a blender. Add orange juice, achiote paste, 4 garlic cloves, \u00bc cup lime juice, and 1 Tbsp. salt and pur\u00e9e until smooth, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1 cup chile sauce, uncovered, at room temperature for serving. Pour remaining sauce over fish and toss to coat. Cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.\nMeanwhile, mix onion, habanero chile, pineapple, 3 Tbsp. cilantro, remaining finely chopped garlic clove, 3 Tbsp. lime juice, and 1\u00bd tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Cover salsa and chill until ready to use.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat; thoroughly clean grate and brush with oil. Working in batches if necessary, grill fish, leaving a few inches of space between each piece, until marinade is dried and beginning to char, about 2 minutes. Using a fish spatula, release fish from grate, turn, and continue to grill until charred on second side and flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.\nGrill tortillas until just beginning to brown in spots, about 30 seconds per side. Top each tortilla with a piece of fish, then a schmear of reserved chile sauce, a spoonful of pineapple salsa, and some cilantro leaves. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.\nDo Ahead: Pineapple salsa can be made 4 hours ahead. Keep chilled.",

Transfer to a food processor and let sit until cool enough to handle.\nReduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Lightly oil 13x9\" pan and line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on both long sides. Lightly oil parchment.\nAdd 1 cup oats to nut mixture in food processor and pulse until nuts are a sandy consistency and no whole oats remain. Transfer to a large bowl.\nPulse any dried fruit larger than a raisin in food processor (no need to wipe out) until about the size of chocolate chips. Transfer to bowl with nut mixture. Add remaining 1 cup oats and stir to combine, breaking up any fruit that is stuck together. Add remaining 3 Tbsp. oil and stir to coat. Add peanut butter, but don\u2019t stir it in; set aside.\nBring honey, salt, and vanilla to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat (it will bubble up). Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until it is foaming vigorously and smells like caramel, about 3 minutes.\nImmediately pour honey mixture over peanut butter in reserved bowl (it will melt the peanut butter). Stir to combine, making sure to aggressively break up any clumps.\nUsing a fork or small whisk, lightly beat egg white in a small bowl to thin out. Add to oat mixture and mix until egg white is no longer visible.\nScrape oat mixture into prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer. (Be sure to really compact the mixture into the pan\u2014it helps to use the bottom of a heavy glass or metal measuring cup.)\nBake granola bars until deep golden brown and no longer sticky or wet, 30-35 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then lightly score into 16 long rectangles (1 cut lengthwise and 7 cuts crosswise will make bars that are about 6\u00bdx1\"). Let cool completely in pan, then use parchment to hoist bars out onto a cutting board. Using a sharp chef\u2019s knife, cut along marks to separate bars.\nDo Ahead: Bars can be made 1 week ahead.

Cover and chill.\nRinse lentils, then soak in 2 cups water at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. (Soaking the lentils makes them tender and a lot easier to blend.)\nMeanwhile, trim ends of zucchini and cut crosswise into 3 pieces about 2\" long. Cut each piece lengthwise into \u00bc\"-thick planks. Stack a few planks and slice lengthwise into \u00bc\"-thick matchsticks (about the size of a skinny french fry). Transfer zucchini to a colander set in a medium bowl. Add onion and 1 tsp. salt and toss to combine. Let sit until vegetables look wilted and softened and about 1 Tbsp. liquid has released into bowl, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Gently pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.\nDrain lentils and transfer to a food processor. Add chile powder, turmeric, and \u00be tsp. salt. Pulse, scraping down sides, until a pur\u00e9e forms. Transfer to a medium bowl and add zucchini and onion, parsley, and lemon zest. Toss with a rubber spatula to combine.\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels; set a wire rack inside. Heat ghee in a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high until a pinch of batter added to the pan sizzles and sputters. Using a large spoon, scoop out about \u00bc cup batter, then use a second large spoon dipped in the hot ghee to carefully scrape into pan; flatten with ghee-coated spoon. Repeat to make 3 more fritters. Fry until deep golden brown underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn over with a wide slotted spatula and fry until deep golden brown on the second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer fritters to prepared rack to drain; season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining batter (you end up with 8\u201310 fritters total).\nTransfer fritters to a platter. Serve with lemony yogurt alongside.",

Reduce heat and simmer, adjusting heat as needed, until potatoes until fork-tender, 15\u201320 minutes. Scoop out \u00bd cup potato cooking liquid and set aside. Drain potatoes in a colander and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, onion powder, mustard, and pepper in a large bowl and mix well to combine. Add garlic and half of chives and mix just to incorporate.\nPlace red onion in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse for several seconds to take away some of its raw bite. Pat dry with paper towels. Mix half of onion into dressing; set aside remaining onion for serving.\nWorking one at a time, set potatoes on a flat surface and crush slightly with the palm of your hand. Add to bowl with dressing along with \u00bc cup potato cooking liquid. Do this while the potatoes are still warm so that they can absorb all of the seasoning. Don't worry if the dressing looks a little loose and watery at the beginning\u2014it will all get absorbed and become creamier as it sits. Taste and season with more salt or, if your dressing looks too thick, a splash of potato cooking liquid.\nTop potatoes with remaining chives and reserved onion and crumble potato chips over.",

Place raisins in a small bowl and pour in hot water to cover; let sit until ready to use.\nPlace cucumbers in a colander or sieve set in or over a large bowl; sprinkle with 1 tsp. salt and toss to combine. Let sit while you make the meatballs. (It will seem like a lot of cucumbers at first, but they will shrink down as they drain.)\nMeanwhile, drizzle 2 Tbsp. oil over a large rimmed baking sheet. Arrange pine nuts in an even layer on another rimmed baking sheet (use a quarter-sheet if you have one!).\nFinely chop \u00bc cup olives. Transfer to a large bowl and add egg, garlic, panko, parsley, 1\u00bd tsp. salt, and \u00bc tsp. red pepper flakes; season with black pepper. Drain raisins and add half to bowl; mix well to combine. Add pork and gently mix with your hands to incorporate. Working one at a time, scoop out heaping tablespoonfuls of pork mixture and form into balls (think about the size of a golf ball; you should get about 20). Arrange on oiled baking sheet, spacing 1\" apart. Turn to coat.\nBake meatballs, rotating baking sheet front to back halfway through, until browned on bottom and cooked through, 10\u201315 minutes. Toast pine nuts on bottom rack until golden brown, about 3 minutes.\nCoarsely chop remaining \u00bd cup olives. Gather cucumbers into a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out any excess liquid into bowl (don\u2019t worry if they get a little smashed); discard liquid. Wipe out bowl and combine cucumbers, olives, pine nuts, onion, herbs, and remaining raisins in bowl; toss to combine. Drizzle in vinegar and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, season with salt and black pepper, and toss again to coat.\nSwoosh a generous scoop of yogurt over each plate, then top with salad and meatballs.

Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.\nMake the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add \u2153 cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined. (You can grind the crumbled graham crackers and mix them with the condensed milk in a food processor if you prefer.) Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.\nOne at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there. Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.\nAdd the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about \u2153 cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.\nSpread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.\nLet the frozen cake stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before slicing. Dipping a thin knife into hot water between each cut, slice the cake into wedges and serve, topping each serving with freshly grated lemon zest.",

Remove them from the skillet, and when they are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the nuts.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add it to a large bowl.\nIn a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Give the mixture a good stir, and then set it aside to infuse for about 5 minutes longer away from the heat.\nPour the butter mixture (scraping the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes) all over the warm pasta. If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.\nSet the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the chard stems and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chard leaves and continue to cook, tossing the mixture every so often, until the greens begin to wilt and turn bright green, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add a touch more butter or oil to the pan if it dries out too much.\nAdd the Swiss chard and hazelnuts to the pasta and toss it all together. Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you\u2019re using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.\nServe warm or at room temperature.\nLocalize it: You can use kale instead of chard, and any nut will work in place of the hazelnuts. Fresh out of balsamic vinegar? Red wine vinegar or freshly squeezed lemon juice will work.",

Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes longer. Pour in the wine and cook until the wine is reduced by about half. Add the basil, salt, and pepper and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes burst and become fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside the tomatoes in a bowl.\nPosition an oven rack about 3 inches from the top and preheat the broiler.\nIn a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the diced white part of the scallions and the minced garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the potato and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the potato softens, about 10 minutes. Add the corn and continue to cook for about 2 minutes longer.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, red pepper flakes, and half the feta cheese. Pour the egg mixture over the veggie mixture in the skillet and top with the remainder of the cheese. Stir in the potato mixture and the scallion greens.\nWipe out the skillet and, over medium-high, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking fat. Cook the frittata, lifting up the cooked egg around the edges with a rubber spatula to let the uncooked eggs flow underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, giving the pan a shake now and again, until the eggs are mostly set but the center is still slightly jiggly, 3 to 5 minutes more.\nTransfer the frittata to the oven and broil until the top is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes (keep a close eye on the frittata, as it can easily burn). Serve topped with the tomato compote.",

            "instructions_full": "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nIn a large, wide bowl, combine the flour, salt, and parsley. Add the butter pieces and, using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut them up and into the flour mixture until it resembles little pebbles. Keep breaking up the bits of butter until the texture is very coarse.\nIn a small dish, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, and water, and combine it with the butter-flour mixture. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir the wet and the dry together until a shaggy dough forms. If needed, get your hands into the bowl to knead it a few times into one big ball. Pat the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill it in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 2 days.\nIn a large skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, thinly slice the tomatoes; toss them with 1 teaspoon salt and let them drain in a colander for 30 minutes, tossing them occasionally.\nIn a bowl, combine the cheeses, mayo, 2 tablespoons each of the chopped basil and parsley, the thyme, a hefty pinch each of salt and pepper, and the saut\u00e9ed onion.\nSprinkle a little flour in the bottom of a 10-inch well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Set it aside.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch circle. Fit it into the prepared skillet, allowing the edges to extend over the sides of the pan.\nSpread the cheese mixture evenly over the bottom of the dough. Arrange the tomatoes on top. Gently fold the overhanging pie crust over the tomatoes. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.\nDrizzle the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon cooking fat and season with pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the beaten egg and milk. Brush the crust with this egg wash, place the cast-iron pan on a rimmed baking sheet (to protect the bottom of your oven from any overflowing filling), and bake the pie until the tomatoes are browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Top the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon each basil and parsley.\nLocalize it: Swap out any of the herbs or cheeses. The Manchego in this recipe is salty, and the mozzarella melts really well, so just keep that in mind when you\u2019re doing your swaps.",

If pork chops have been chilling in the fridge, let sit at room temperature while you make the escab\u00e8che.\nFinely grind coriander seeds in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle; set aside. Heat a dry large skillet over high. Add chiles in a single layer and cook, turning with tongs or a large spoon, until evenly blistered on all sides and deeply browned in spots, 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer chiles to a small pot; reserve skillet. Add red onion, garlic, carrots, red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, honey, paprika, reserved ground coriander, 4 Tbsp. oil, remaining 4 tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. water to pot. Set over low heat, cover, and bring liquid to a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring vegetables often to keep submerged, until just-cooked through and still al dente, about 10 minutes. Remove escab\u00e8che from heat and stir in oregano.\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in reserved skillet over high. Arrange pork chops in pan so bone ends are in the center (this part cooks slower and this will help with even browning) and press down on pork chops with tongs to ensure surface is making good contact with the pan. Cook until golden underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn pork chops over and press down on them again. Transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130\u00b0 for medium (you should still have a little pink flesh; temperature should rise to about 145\u00b0 when the pork chops rest), 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.\nTo serve, transfer pork chops to plates and spoon escab\u00e8che over.\nDo ahead: Escab\u00e8che can be made 2 weeks ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and let cool. Cover and chill.",

Add the gochugaru, garlic, and soy sauce and simmer for another 10 minutes.\nAdd the onions and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and simmer for 5 minutes. (Adding the vegetables at different times will ensure that they will all be fully cooked at the end.) Add the chili peppers, beef, and tofu and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more soy sauce if necessary.\nRemove the pot from the heat, add the scallions, put on the lid, and let the stew rest for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 hours, before serving. Serve with steamed rice and your favorite banchan, as any and all pair well with this stew.",

Transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, add the potato starch, close the bag, and mix well by flipping the bag over and back again until the chicken is well coated.\nPlace a large mesh strainer over a bowl.\nHeat 2 inches vegetable oil in a large, deep pan or wok over medium-high heat until it reaches about 340\u00b0F, 8 to 10 minutes. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a tip of a chicken piece into the oil. If it bubbles, it\u2019s ready. Carefully add the chicken to the oil one piece at a time, working in batches to avoid overcrowding.\nDeep-fry, turning the chicken with tongs, until all sides are light golden brown and crunchy, 10 to 12 minutes. As each piece is done, transfer it to the strainer. Once the chicken has drained, transfer it to a large bowl. Repeat with the rest of the chicken, making sure to bring the oil back up to 340\u00b0F between batches.\nReturn the oil to 340\u00b0F over high heat and carefully add all the chicken\u2014there\u2019s no need to work in batches this time. The chicken will look a little soggy at first. Deep-fry, turning occasionally, until all the chicken pieces are dark golden brown and very crunchy, another 10 to 13 minutes. Transfer the chicken pieces to the strainer or a rack to drain, then place in a large bowl.\nIf using the peanuts, place them in a slotted spoon or a small mesh strainer, carefully dip them into the hot oil, and fry for 15 to 30 seconds, just until light golden brown. Transfer to a small bowl.\nMix the rice syrup, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, and mustard in a small bowl.\nHeat a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the oil, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers and stir for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the garlic is a little crispy and fragrant. Add the soy sauce mixture and stir. Let it bubble for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is shiny and a little sticky. Remove from the heat if not using right away and reheat until bubbling when ready to finish the chicken.\nAdd the chicken and peanuts (if using) to the bubbling sauce and toss with a wooden spoon to coat nicely. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and a few teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes (if using). Transfer to a large plate or platter and serve. The chicken will remain crunchy for several hours if left at room temperature, or you can cover and refrigerate it for up to 3 days.",

Add the pork and turn to coat the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\nThe next day, set a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Once it\u2019s hot, add the pork, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan and leaving any liquid in the bowl. Cook, stirring occasionally and flipping the meat, until lightly caramelized and golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. (If you overcrowd the pan, the meat will steam instead of sear.) Transfer to a platter.\nWhen the meat is cooked, open the buns, butter the interiors, and toast them until they are a light golden brown.\nTo serve, spread both cut sides of each bun with a healthy smear of mayo and pile the spicy pork generously on the bottoms of the buns. Top with the sliced cucumbers. Serve immediately.\nThe pork belly must be marinated overnight. You can also grill the pork on an outdoor grill over a high flame. The sugars in the marinade will char and caramelize, giving you a more interesting texture and flavor, but be careful not to burn the pork.",

            "instructions_full": "Spatchcock chicken the Thai way by placing it breast side up on a large cutting board. Using a sharp, heavy knife and working just to the side of the center of the breast, cut down through to the breastbone (do not cut all the way through to the backbone). Now that the path has been created, use the same knife\u2014or, easier, a sturdy pair of kitchen scissors\u2014to make a clean cut all the way through the breastbone and anything else that is still connecting the 2 sides of the breast together. Open up chicken and turn skin side up. Press down on chicken to flatten. Pat thoroughly dry.\nGrind peppercorns in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a food processor or leave in mortar and pestle and add garlic, cilantro roots, brown sugar, fish sauce, turmeric, salt, coriander, cumin, and cardamom and process or pound until smooth. Coat chicken completely in marinade, pressing to adhere and working into nooks and crannies. Place in a large bowl and cover with a plate. Let chill at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.\nLet chicken sit at room temperature 1 hour before grilling or baking.\nPur\u00e9e pineapple and vinegar in a food processor or blender until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan and add garlic, jalape\u00f1os, granulated sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat so sauce is at a simmer and cook until thick and smooth (consistency should be similar to cocktail sauce), about 5 minutes.\nGrind saffron to a fine powder in a spice mill or a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small saucepan and add granulated sugar, salt, and \u00bc cup water and cook over medium heat just until heated through and small bubbles appear around the edges of the pan. Whisk in coconut oil and remove from heat.\nIf using a grill, prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on cooler part of grill. Close lid and grill, rotating chicken but keeping skin side up every 5\u201310 minutes, until skin looks dry and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0, 35\u201340 minutes. If using charcoal and your coals are dying, start a new chimney of coals 15 minutes before this point so you are ready for the next step.\nUncover grill and increase heat to high (add more coals for a charcoal grill). Brush one fourth of basting liquid over skin and turn chicken over, positioning over direct heat on the hot side of the grill. Grill, brushing half of remaining basting liquid over bone side of chicken, until skin is browned and lightly charred in spots, about 3 minutes. (Watch carefully as this can happen quickly.) Turn chicken over and return to cooler side of grill. Brush skin with remaining basting liquid. Cover grill and continue to grill chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0 and thickest part of thighs registers 165\u00b0, 10\u201315 minutes longer.\nIf using an oven, place a rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Place chicken, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Brush one third of basting liquid over skin. Bake, rotating baking sheet every 10 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0, 35\u201340 minutes.\nIncrease oven temperature to 450\u00b0. Brush remaining basting liquid over skin and continue to bake, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is crisp and charred and thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0 and thickest part of thighs registers 165\u00b0, 10\u201315 minutes longer.\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest at least 15 minutes. Carve up further as desired.\nTop dipping sauce with cilantro. Serve chicken with rice and dipping sauce alongside.\nIf you cook the chicken in the oven, using the dhungar method to perfume the finished chicken with the scent of smoky ghee is highly recommended.",

Add butter and rub and smash into dry ingredients with your fingers to create large, shaggy pieces (you want some pieces that are flat and thin and some that are large and irregular).\nDrizzle egg yolk mixture over flour and, using a fork or your fingers, toss into dough to incorporate. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it will still look a little dry; although, if it looks too dry and doesn't come together, add 1\u20132 Tbsp. more water, but only if needed).\nTurn dough out onto a clean work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times. Divide dough in half, stack pieces, and press down firmly to smash together. Repeat process until dough is well combined and becomes slightly sticky, 2\u20143 more times. Press dough into bottom and 1\" up sides of pan and prick all over with a fork. Freeze until very firm, 20\u201330 minutes.\nBake crust until deep golden brown all over, 35\u201340 minutes. Let cool.\nDo Ahead: Crust can be baked 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\nBring milk and vanilla paste to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat.\nMeanwhile, whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl, starting slowly\u2014it won\u2019t want to combine easily at first\u2014then vigorously whisk until mixture is very pale yellow and very thick, about 1 minute (the sugar should be nearly dissolved at this point). Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk mixture. Return custard base to saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Simmer, still whisking constantly, until custard is thickened and has no cornstarch taste, about 3 minutes.\nRemove custard from heat and add butter a couple of pieces at a time, whisking until fully melted before adding more, until all of the butter is incorporated. Transfer to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against surface. Let cool.\nVigorously whisk custard until smooth and slightly loosened. Scrape into crust and smooth surface. Top with berries.\nDo Ahead: Custard can be made 4 days ahead. Keep chilled.",

Immediately transfer to a large bowl.\nMeanwhile, finely grate zest from lemon into a medium bowl; set aside. Place peaches in a 13x9\" baking dish. Halve lemon and squeeze 1 Tbsp. juice over peaches, then sprinkle \u2153 cup sugar and \u00be tsp. salt over. Toss to gently combine, then let sit while you prep the topping, at least 20 minutes.\nAdd flour and remaining 1\u00bc cups sugar and 1 tsp. salt to bowl with sesame seeds. Whisk to combine.\nAdd butter and cinnamon to bowl with lemon zest. Microwave until butter is melted, about 1 minute. (Or, if you don't have a microwave, melt butter with cinnamon and lemon zest in a small saucepan over medium.) Whisk in tahini and oil.\nScrape tahini mixture into dry ingredients and mix until incorporated (mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand).\nThe peaches should look juicy at this point. Add 1 tsp. cornstarch. If they\u2019re really juicy, add another 1 tsp. Gently toss to combine. (If your peaches happen to be not-so-ripe and aren't juicy, don't add any cornstarch.)\nSqueeze topping into big clumps, then break off uneven pieces and scatter over peaches.\nBake crumble until topping is well browned and firm, peaches are tender, and juices are bubbling, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly.\nDivide crumble among shallow bowls and add a scoop of ice cream if desired.",

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli to a large bowl.\nAdd the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for al dente, about 9 minutes.\nMeanwhile, toast the bread crumbs. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil in a large, high-sided saut\u00e9 pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and saut\u00e9 until the crumbs are golden brown and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.\nPour the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into the pan. Add the anchovies and saut\u00e9 until they disintegrate, about 1 minute. Add the capers, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 1 minute, and remove from the heat.\nWhen the pasta is ready, reserve 1\u00bd cups (360 ml) of pasta water with a measuring cup, then drain the pasta. Add the broccoli and reserved pasta water to the pan and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer, using a wooden spoon to break the florets into small pieces as they become more tender, until the water is reduced by about half and you've been able to break apart enough florets that you're left with a very chunky mixture, 5 to 7 minutes.\nAdd the pasta to the pan. Cook, tossing and stirring, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce thickens and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add half the toasted bread crumbs, and toss again to combine. Serve garnished with the remaining toasted bread crumbs.",

            "instructions_full": "Put the water, dashima, shiitake mushrooms, and anchovies in a covered stockpot or other large pot and let stand at room temperature overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.\nRemove the lid, set the pot over high heat, and heat until the surface of the water begins to ripple; pay attention, and do not let it come to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.\nStrain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.\nIt\u2019s best to use dashi the same day you make it, though if you keep it refrigerated, you can use it for another day or two. By the third day, it will no longer taste fresh.\nVegetarians can make a dashi from just dashima and dried shiitakes.",

            "instructions_full": "Bring 1\u00bd cups (360 ml) of the water to a boil. Put the tamarind pulp in a heat-proof nonreactive bowl, and cover with the boiling water. Cover and let sit for about 1 hour, until the pulp has become soft and mushy. Using a small potato masher or clean hands, massage and squeeze the block to soften the pulp. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer suspended over a medium bowl, pressing the pulp through the strainer with a large spoon. Discard the seeds and other solids left behind. Refrigerate the tamarind extract in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, for up to 4 days.\nRinse the ginger and gently scrub to remove any traces of dirt. If the ginger is young, with a thin skin, leave the skin on. Otherwise, peel. Cut into thin slices. In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, and remaining 1 cup (240 ml) water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover and steep for 10 minutes. Strain the ginger simple syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the ginger.\nIn a large pitcher, mix the tamarind extract and the ginger simple syrup together. Fill eight tall glasses with ice. Pour 4 oz (120 ml) of the tamarind-ginger syrup into each glass, top with 4 oz (120 ml) of the club soda or chilled water, and stir. Store any remaining tamarind-ginger syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nThis rejuvenating drink combines the mild heat of young ginger and the sourness of tamarind. It\u2019s wonderful during the warmer months. Young ginger requires no peeling before use because its outer skin is so thin. I recommend using South Asian tamarind, which is a lot more sour than the Mexican variety. Look for it in Asian and Indian markets.",

Remove from the heat and stir in the sumac. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let it steep for 30 minutes, no more. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer over a medium bowl and chill before ready to serve.\nTo serve, fill four tall glasses with ice. In a large pitcher, stir the syrup with the chilled club soda or water. Pour 1 cup (120 ml) of the drink into each glass. Garnish each glass with 1 or 2 saffron strands. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nSumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.",

Lightly grease a 13x9\" baking tin and line with a piece of parchment paper that overhangs the two long sides. Secure in place with metal clips.\nFor the peanut butter cookie layer, mix the peanut butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl for a couple of minutes until combined and slightly lightened. Add the egg and egg yolks and beat together for a further 2\u20133 minutes. Add all the remaining ingredients (reserving 3 tablespoons of the peanuts for sprinkling over later) and gently mix together to form a uniform cookie dough. Spread the cookie dough in an even layer in the prepared tin, then set aside.\nFor the brownie layer, add the butter and cocoa to a small saucepan over a medium heat, stirring constantly, until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. Place the sugars, salt, vanilla and eggs in a large bowl and whisk together with an electric mixer for 2\u20133 minutes or until slightly thickened and pale. Pour in the melted butter mixture, mixing briefly until combined, then fold in the flour. Pour the batter over the cookie layer and spread into an even layer, then sprinkle over the reserved peanuts.\nBake for about 25\u201330 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out with a few moist crumbs.\nLeave the brookies to cool completely in the tin, before using the parchment paper to lift them from the tin and cutting into squares.Store in a sealed container for 3\u20134 days.",

Add the garlic and continue to cook for 3 minutes. (If, at any time during the cooking process, the items in the pan dry out at all, deglaze the pan with some lime juice, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon, and continue.) Turn the heat to medium and add the chiles. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the chiles are thoroughly cooked.\nAt this point, warm a separate frying pan over medium heat and add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Interleaved with finishing the rest of the recipe, heat each tortilla in the oil-coated pan for about 20 seconds per side, just long enough to make them the slightest bit golden but still pliable, and put between two towels to stay warm and wick away any excess oil.\nOnce the chiles have cooked for 10 minutes, pour the lime juice on the ingredients in the pan. Add the diced bacon to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the pan has heated up and the bacon has started to turn color, add the shrimp and use the salt to season everything in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and flipping the shrimp as necessary to cook them evenly. The shrimp should be bright pink and white and opaque. If they are still translucent, cook them a little longer.\nSprinkle the cheese over everything in the pan and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the heat. Distribute the cheesy shrimp mixture equally among the tortillas, making a plate full of tacos. Serve along with the lime wedges and red salsa, if desired.",

            "instructions_full": "Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F. Place crackers in a deep pie dish (a shallower one will work but you may have some filling left over) and gently crush with your hands until you have a mix of dime-size pieces, small crumbs, and everything in between. Add peanuts, brown sugar, and salt and toss to combine. Drizzle in butter and toss to evenly coat. Using your hands and the bottom of a measuring cup, press firmly and evenly into bottom and up sides of dish. (Mixture will look and feel crumbly, but it will hold together when baked.) Bake crust until a shade darker, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool.\nDo Ahead: Crust can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature, or freeze up to 1 month.\nPour water into a medium saucepan to come 1\u00bd\" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you\u2019ve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165\u00b0F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes. (Or, if using a stand mixer, beat with the whisk attachment, 6\u20138 minutes.)\nUsing spatula, mix peanut butter in another large bowl to loosen up and smooth out. Stir one third of egg mixture into peanut butter to lighten, then gently fold in half of remaining egg mixture, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl, until just combined. Repeat with remaining egg mixture (it will lose a lot of volume, and that\u2019s okay).\nStarting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high, beat cream in the same bowl you used for egg mixture (no need to wash) until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gently fold into peanut butter mixture and scrape into crust. Dollop jelly all over; swirl with a butter knife. (For more defined swirls, freeze pie 30 minutes before adding jelly.) Freeze at least 8 hours before serving.\nTo slice, run a chef\u2019s knife under hot water to warm up the blade, then wipe to clean and dry between slices. Use an offset spatula or fork to loosen slices from dish. If pie is frozen very hard, you may need to let it temper in the fridge 30 minutes before serving.\nDo Ahead: Pie can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap tightly and freeze.",

Transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water with slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 2 minutes. Remove eggs from ice water; peel and slice in half lengthwise.\nPack radish slices into a pint jar. Whisk vinegar, 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp. salt, and \u00bd cup hot water in a small bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved. Pour brine over radish slices; let cool. Cover and chill at least 1 hour before using.\nCut tofu crosswise into \u00bd\"-thick slabs, then cut each slab on a diagonal to create 2 triangles. Pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Heat 2 Tbsp. grapeseed oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add tofu in a single layer, season with salt, and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown underneath, about 4 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden brown on second side, about 4 minutes. Transfer tofu to a plate; reserve skillet (no need to wipe out).\nWhisk lime juice, gochujang, mayonnaise, \u00bc cup grapeseed oil, 1 Tbsp. soy sauce, 1 Tbsp. sesame oil, and remaining 1 Tbsp. sugar in a small bowl. Taste; season with salt if desired.\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. grapeseed oil in reserved skillet over medium-high. Add zucchini, season with salt, and cook, tossing just once or twice, until tender and blistered in spots, about 4 minutes. Add remaining 1 tsp. soy sauce and 1 tsp. sesame oil and toss to coat. Transfer to a plate.\nTo serve, divide farro among bowls. Arrange eggs, drained pickled radish, tofu, zucchini, and raw vegetables of choice on top as desired. Drizzle each bowl with a few spoonfuls of dressing to your liking.",

Add za\u2019atar and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and slightly darkened in color, about 1 minute. Add lemon zest and garlic, cook 10 seconds, then remove from heat. (You're looking to cook off the raw flavor of the garlic without losing the brightness of the lemon.) Transfer za\u2019atar oil to a heatproof measuring cup.\nPlace pita chips in a large bowl and drizzle 2 Tbsp. za\u2019atar oil over; season with salt. Mix well with a rubber spatula, aiming to coat chips without breaking them into too many pieces.\nCut reserved lemon in half and squeeze juice from 1 lemon half into a small bowl. Stir in honey and remaining \u00bd tsp. salt. Gradually add remaining za'atar oil, stirring constantly until emulsified. Taste dressing and add more lemon juice, honey, or salt if needed.\nAdd feta, basil, mint, and reserved tomatoes to bowl with chips and drizzle dressing over; toss gently to combine.\nSpoon salad onto platter, making sure to leave no juices behind.

Using tongs, transfer chicken to a plate, arranging skin side up.\nCombine tomatoes, harissa paste, vinegar, 1 oregano sprig, and \u00bd tsp. salt in same skillet. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes burst and their juices start to thicken, 8\u201310 minutes.\nNestle chicken thighs into tomatoes, skin side up. Reduce heat to medium-low, bring to a simmer, and cook until chicken is just cooked through and flesh is no longer pink (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part near the bone will register 165\u00b0F), and tomato sauce is thickened so that a wooden spoon dragged through it leaves a trail, 6\u20138 minutes.

Transfer 4 Tbsp. to a small bowl; set aside.\nScrape reserved browned butter over pistachios in food processor; add egg, brown sugar, flour, salt, and baking powder. Pulse until incorporated, then process, scraping down sides as needed, until mixture looks like wet sand and holds together when squeezed in your hand, about 2 minutes.\nPress dough evenly into bottom and about 2\" up sides of pan with a straight-sided glass or measuring cup. Chill while you make the filling.\nProcess eggs and brown sugar in clean food processor until eggs are well combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down sides; add sour cream, vanilla bean paste, cardamom, ginger, orange zest, and salt. Sprinkle flour and 2 Tbsp. reserved pistachios over; process until smooth, about 1 minute.\nStarting at the edges of the chilled tart shell and working inward, arrange stone fruit in snug concentric circles, standing each wedge up so one tip is raised and rounded skin side is pressed against crust. Carefully pour custard around fruit (fruit should not be completely covered). Sprinkle coarse sugar over.\nBake pie until crust is golden brown and filling is puffed and set in the center (it shouldn\u2019t wobble when gently shaken), 70\u201375 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and scatter remaining reserved 2 Tbsp. pistachios over. Let cool, then chill, uncovered, until fully set.\nUnmold tart. Dust with powdered sugar and/or top with dollops of whipped cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche if desired. Serve chilled or room temperature.",

Pour bacon fat into a small bowl; set aside. Wipe out skillet.\nHeat 2 Tbsp. reserved bacon fat in same skillet.

Wipe out skillet.\nHeat another 1 Tbsp. bacon fat (if you\u2019ve run out, use vegetable or olive oil) in same skillet and cook peach halves, cut side down, until lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let sit until cool enough to handle. Slice each half in half again or into thirds and add to bowl with tomatoes.

            "instructions_full": "To make the sauce, put the oil into a saucepan or casserole pan with a lid\u2014about 10 inches/25cm wide\u2014and place over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2\u00bd tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.\nTo make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1\u00bd tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.\nTrim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin\u2014about \u215b inch/3mm away\u2014but not so close that it tears and won\u2019t hold its shape when it\u2019s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don\u2019t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife\u2014be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!\nUse the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about \u215b inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about \u00bd inch/1cm from the end intact\u2014they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.\nUsing your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about \u00bd inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.\nGently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won\u2019t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft\u2014test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don\u2019t worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.\nTo make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don\u2019t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside\u2014it will crisp up as it cools down\u2014and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.\nWhen the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha\u2014the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic\u2014then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yogurt spooned alongside.",

Stir, then drain through a colander, squeezing out most of the moisture from the bread. (If using grated zucchini, toss it with \u00bd tsp of salt and place in a sieve set over a bowl. Let to sit for 20 minutes, then use your hands to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.)\nTransfer the crumbs to a large bowl with the chicken, garlic, spices, herbs, lemon zest, \u00be tsp salt, and plenty of black pepper. Using well-oiled hands, shape into about 30 small balls; roughly a scant 1 oz/25g each.\nPut 1 tbsp of oil into a large nonstick saut\u00e9 pan with a lid, and place over high heat. Once hot, add half the meatballs and cook for 2\u20133 minutes, turning throughout, until golden brown all over. Transfer the meatballs to a baking sheet and set aside. Keep the pan on the heat and continue with the remaining 1 tbsp of oil and remaining meatballs in the same way.\nReturn the same pan to medium-high heat. Add the 2 garlic cloves, lemon rind, and stock and bring to a boil\u2014this should take about 3 minutes. Add the molokhieh (or the spinach and okra combination), cinnamon, 2 tsp of salt, and plenty of black pepper, then decrease the heat to medium and cook, covered, for about 20 minutes, or until the molokhieh is bubbling and completely defrosted. Add the meatballs, parsley, and \u00bd cup/10g of cilantro and cook, covered, for another 10 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Stir in the lemon juice.\nTo make the adha, meanwhile, put the olive oil into a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until golden and crispy. Add the chile flakes, then remove from the heat and pour into a bowl. Stir in the cilantro and set aside.\nDivide the soup among four bowls and top with the fried garlic and remaining \u00bd cup/10g cilantro. Serve at once, with lemon wedges alongside.",

Form into 6 patties about \u00be\" thick.\nHeat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet (patties will stick to a regular skillet) over medium. Cook 3 patties until deeply browned and crisp underneath, about 3 minutes. Carefully turn over; cook, adding more oil as needed to maintain a light coating around patties, until deeply browned and crisp on the other side, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining patties and 1 Tbsp. oil.\nSpread cut side of buns with reserved yogurt mixture. Build burgers with buns, patties, sprouts, and pickles.",

Whisk in \u00bc cup oil, then add chile and ginger. Season dressing with salt. Let sit while you grill carrots (this will give the chile and ginger time to infuse into dressing).\nToss carrots and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil on a rimmed baking sheet to coat; season with salt. Grill carrots, turning occasionally, until lightly charred in spots and tender, 14\u201318 minutes. Immediately transfer carrots to bowl with dressing and toss to coat. Taste and season with more salt if needed.\nArrange carrots and avocados on a platter and spoon any dressing left in bowl over. Top with mint.",

            "instructions_full": "Bring plums, brown sugar, and salt to a boil in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is softened and juices deepen in color, about 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pushing plum flesh through; discard skins. Return sauce to pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, still stirring, until reduced to about \u2154 cup, about 3 minutes. Pour ripple into a jar and let cool, then cover and chill 1 hour before using.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside.\nLightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining \u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly.\nStir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes.\nTransfer pan to a wire rack and let blondie base cool. Run a knife around the sides to help base release but keep springform pan intact, then cover and chill in freezer at least 15 minutes or until ready to use.\nCut 3 pints of ice cream out of their containers and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted.\nRemove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple. Top with a final layer of remaining softened ice cream, smooth surface, then drizzle with remaining maple ripple and plum ripple. (If at any point the ice cream gets so soft that you can\u2019t achieve distinct layers, chill in freezer for a few minutes.) Freeze, uncovered, 2 hours, then cover and freeze at least 8 hours before serving.\nTo serve, run a knife or offset spatula around edge of pan to release. Unmold and remove parchment paper; discard. Transfer cake to a platter, smooth sides with an offset spatula, and freeze 10 minutes. Slice with a warm knife, wiping off between cuts.",

Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool; coarsely grind. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in oregano. Place pork on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and rub with oil. Season all over with 1 Tbsp. salt, then rub with spice mixture, packing it on. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours or chill, uncovered, up to 2 days.\nBring chiles, vinegar, butter, and sugar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and sauce is reduced by about a third, about 5 minutes. Season with salt; cover and keep warm over low heat until ready to use.\nPrepare a grill for medium heat. Drizzle pork all over with oil, then grill, turning every 5 minutes or so, until extremely, gorgeously browned and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 120\u00b0F, 35\u201345 minutes. Continue to grill, brushing with sauce and turning not quite every minute (you\u2019re going to see flare-ups, but don\u2019t worry), until pork is glazed and shiny and temperature on thermometer has risen to 130\u00b0F, 5\u201310 minutes more. Transfer pork to a platter and let rest 30 minutes; reserve remaining sauce.\nTransfer pork to a cutting board and pour any accumulated juices on platter into reserved sauce. Return sauce to a simmer. Slice pork against the grain \u00bc\" thick. Arrange on platter, spoon some sauce over, and season with salt. Serve remaining sauce alongside.\nIf using a charcoal grill, a bed of medium-hot coals will gradually lose heat. Get a chimney started when the meat first hits the grill. About halfway through, throw some new glowing coals on the pile to keep things going.",

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring glass, pressing on solids; discard solids. Pour back into saucepan and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, 10\u201315 minutes. (You should have about 6 Tbsp.) Transfer back to measuring glass and chill until cold, about 30 minutes.\nMix condensed milk, almond extract, and remaining \u00be tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine.\nUsing an electric mixer, beat cream in a medium bowl, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes.\nAdd a dollop of whipped cream to condensed milk mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage\u2014folding\u2014is easier). Add remaining whipped cream; fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of condensed milk mixture remain.\nScrape about one third of ice cream base into a loaf pan that\u2019s at least 8\u00bdx4\u00bd\". Drizzle over one third of raspberry syrup. Repeat layers 2 more times, ending with raspberry syrup (no need to be precise). Using a small offset spatula or butter knife, make figure-eight motions through ice cream base to swirl raspberry syrup throughout. Cover with plastic wrap or an airtight silicone lid and freeze until solid, at least 8 hours.\nTo serve, transfer loaf pan to refrigerator and let ice cream soften 10 minutes before scooping into bowls.\nDo Ahead: Ice cream can be made 1 week ahead.

            "instructions_full": "Bring mint and 1 cup cream to a bare simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring glass, pressing on solids; discard solids. Chill cream until very cold, about 30 minutes.\nJust before cream is ready, heat chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, heat in 20-second increments in a microwave, stirring between bursts.) Mix together sweetened condensed milk and salt in a medium bowl.\nPour remaining 1 cup cream into infused cream in measuring glass. (You should have 2 cups; add more if needed.) Transfer to a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat cream, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes.\nAdd a dollop of whipped cream to condensed milk mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage\u2014folding\u2014is easier). Add remaining whipped cream, then sift in cocoa powder. Fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of condensed milk mixture remain and cocoa powder is combined.\nScrape about one quarter of ice cream base into a loaf pan that\u2019s at least 8\u00bdx4\u00bd\". Using a fork, drizzle about one third of melted chocolate over. Repeat layering process, finishing with a layer of ice cream base, to create 4 layers of ice cream base total and 3 layers of drizzled chocolate. Cover with plastic wrap or an airtight silicone lid and freeze until solid, at least 8 hours.\nTo serve, transfer loaf pan to refrigerator and let ice cream soften 10 minutes before scooping into bowls.\nDo Ahead: Ice cream can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.",

The cake batter will appear to be very loose and wet at this point, but don\u2019t worry, the cassava will absorb most of the liquid during baking. Place the cake pan into the oven and bake until the top of the cake appears dry and no liquid is floating on the surface, 45\u201360 minutes.\nMeanwhile, to make the topping, whisk together the egg whites and the \u00bc cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk in a medium bowl until very well incorporated. Although you are using egg whites, don\u2019t be concerned with making a foam or a meringue, just mix until combined.\nRemove the cake from the oven and evenly pour the topping onto the cake. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the topping sets, about 10 minutes more.\nRemove the cake from the oven and rest the cake in its pan on a cooling rack. Cool the cake completely before cutting it into squares. The cassava cake can be served at room temperature, or cold out of the refrigerator.",

Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top.\nIn the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1\u00bd cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\nPlop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so it\u2019s no more than about \u00bd inch thick in any one place.\nSprinkle the remaining \u00bd cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. It\u2019s a strange method, but it works.)\nBake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dry\u2014be sure to check in a few places.)\nLet the cobbler sit for about a half an hour to firm up before serving warm in big bowls, with heavy cream poured on top.",

            "instructions_full": "To make the batter, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, doenjang, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well to blend. Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.\nSet a 10-inch nonstick saut\u00e9 pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don\u2019t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200\u00b0F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it\u2019s best to eat them right away.\nCut each pancake into quarters and serve with small bowls of the Pajeon Sauce and ice-cold makgeolli (Korean rice wine).",

            "instructions_full": "Pre-Prep: Trim fresh vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, radish, and others into bite sized pieces, and no larger than the container they will be stored in. Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.\nIf using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.\nMethod: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.\nTo Store: Use smaller (4 \u2013 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge. The pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two. Serve using a clean and dry fork or spoon for each serving to avoid contamination.",

(Some varieties of paneer are made without salt; if using one of these, season your pieces of cheese while cooking.) Transfer to a plate.\nAdd remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to same pan, then add sweet peppers and oregano. Season with kosher salt and black pepper and cook over medium-high, stirring and pressing down occasionally on sweet peppers with a wooden spoon so they make good contact with the pan, until softened and blistered in spots, 20\u201325 minutes.

Pat fish dry, rub all over with oil, and season with salt and Aleppo-style pepper.

The skin should release easily from the grate when the fish is ready to turn.

(Or roll up in a kitchen towel and gently crush with a rolling pin.)\nWhisk labneh (or strained yogurt), condensed milk, lime zest and juice, and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.\nUsing an electric mixer, beat cream in a medium bowl, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes.\nAdd a dollop of whipped cream to labneh mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage\u2014folding\u2014is easier). Add remaining whipped cream and fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of labneh mixture remain. Fold in granola; scrape ice cream base into a loaf pan that\u2019s at least 8\u00bdx4\u00bd\". Cover with plastic wrap or an airtight silicone lid and freeze until solid, at least 8 hours.\nTo serve, transfer loaf pan to refrigerator and let ice cream soften 10 minutes before scooping into bowls.\nDo Ahead: Ice cream can be made 1 week ahead.

Sprinkle 1\u20132 Tbsp. cooled amaranth over mixture and pulse until just combined. Repeat process until all of amaranth has been incorporated. Taste and season pur\u00e9e with pepper and more salt if needed. Scoop onto a parchment-lined baking sheet to make 6 portions (a cookie scoop works great if you\u2019ve got one) and form into patties that match the size of your buns. Freeze 30 minutes.\nWhile the patties are chilling, make the sauce. Whisk barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, chili-garlic sauce, mustard, lemon juice, and vinegar in a small bowl to combine. Sauce should taste spicy, tart, and sweet.\nHeat a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-low. Pour in oil just to thinly coat bottom of pan. Working in 3 batches to avoid crowding, cook patties, adjusting heat and adding more oil as needed, until browned (a crisp crust should form), about 5 minutes per side. (You can keep patties warm on a fresh parchment-lined baking sheet in a 250\u00b0 oven if needed.)\nBuild burgers with patties, buns, sauce, and chowchow.\nDo ahead: Sauce can be made 1 month ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before serving.",

Add both vinegars, sugar, mustard, and turmeric. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes.\nAdd garlic and drained vegetables to pickling liquid and mix well. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil; cook 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have melded and liquid is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. The cabbage and green tomatoes should still have a bit of a crunch. Let cool (this will take about 1 hour).\nUsing a slotted spoon, divide chowchow among sterilized glass jars of choice and spoon pickling liquid over (chowchow should be submerged and there should be about \u00bd\" space at the top of each jar.

Cover and chill.\nCombine Yukon Gold and sweet potatoes in a large pot, pour in water to cover, and season with salt if desired. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until fork-tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl (potatoes will be crushed at this point, especially the sweet potato, and that\u2019s okay).\nMeanwhile, mix mayonnaise and 2 Tbsp. jerk rub in a small bowl to combine (you will have leftover rub, see headnote for other uses). Set dressing aside.\nAdd red onion, scallions, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton kosher salt, and \u00bd tsp. black pepper to potatoes and toss to combine. Add dressing and fold into potatoes with a rubber spatula until well coated. Serve potato salad warm, room temperature, or chilled.\nDo ahead: Potato salad can be made 2 days ahead (it will get more spicy). Cover and chill.",

            "instructions_full": "The morning before you make your batter, rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold running water, until water runs almost clear. Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.\nPick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.\nDrain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then pur\u00e9e, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.\nAdd reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4\u20136 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.\nDo ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.\nHeat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7\u20139 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.\nWipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.\nTo cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you\u2019re good to go. (It\u2019s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it\u2019s too hot, the batter will start to cook before it\u2019s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous \u2153-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8\"-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle \u215b tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.\nServe dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping.",

Reduce the heat to its lowest possible level, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, and buttermilk. Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and stir to combine.

Bake until the top springs back when lightly pressed and a skewer inserted in the center comes out with some moist crumbs attached, 45 to 55 minutes.\nTransfer the pan to a wire rack and let it cool for 10 minutes.

Set aside for serving.\nBlend garlic, dill, mint, tahini, and \u2153 cup water in a blender or food processor until a thick paste forms. Add lemon juice and blend again, adding an additional 1\u20132 Tbsp. water if sauce is too thick. It should be easily spreadable but not runny. Season with salt and lots of pepper.\nRemove outer leaves and trim stem from cauliflower so it sits flat. Cut cauliflower into 4 wedges.\nWhisk oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl to combine. Add cauliflower and coat in oil. The cauliflower can fall apart easily, so handle with care and use your fingers to work oil into the uneven surface.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat (if using a charcoal grill, bank most of the coals on one side of the grill). Place cauliflower, cut side down, on grate over hottest part of grill and grill, undisturbed, until char marks form, about 3 minutes (you can carefully lift to check, but try not to move too much). Turn over onto other cut side and grill, undisturbed, until grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Turn onto uneven floret side and slide over to cooler part of grill or reduce heat to low and cover with lid. Grill until tender (if a bamboo skewer easily slides through the thickest part, it\u2019s done), 10\u201315 minutes. (And if you don\u2019t have a grill, you can do this in a grill pan over high. Once pan is very hot, add cauliflower, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook both cut sides as above. When you turn cauliflower over onto uneven floret side, reduce heat to low and cover pan with foil to finish cooking.)\nTo serve, spread some tarator onto individual plates or a platter. Arrange cauliflower wedges on top and dollop remaining tarator over. Scatter mixed tender herbs and almonds on top.",

Let sit 3 minutes.\nMeanwhile, very thinly slice Pecorino into tiles with a knife (irregular pieces are okay).\nAdd Pecorino, herbs, and oil to pickled shallots and toss gently to combine. Taste and season with more salt if needed; set aside.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat; clean grate. Working one at a time, set mushrooms on their sides and slice lengthwise \u00bc\" thick to make 3\u20134 planks per mushroom, depending their size. If your mushrooms are particularly small or you are using crimini, slice \u00bd\" thick and thread onto skewers to keep them from falling through grate.\nUsing some of the oil, brush cut sides of mushrooms and transfer to a large bowl or arrange on a rimmed baking sheet if skewered. Lightly brush both sides of each slice of bread with remaining oil and transfer to a platter.\nPress each slice of bread down across grate for even contact and grill until browned with some lightly charred spots, about 2 minutes per side. The goal is a crunchy exterior with a still chewy center. Transfer bread back to platter.\nBrush grate to clean. If using a gas grill, turn heat down to medium. A charcoal grill should be at the tail end of medium-high and headed toward medium at this point, but wait a few minutes if needed. Grill mushrooms, turning halfway through and moving around as needed to avoid flare-ups, until golden all over with lightly charred edges, 6\u20138 minutes for small pieces and 8\u201310 minutes for large ones. Return to bowl (slide off of skewers if needed). Add Pecorino salsa verde and toss to combine. Spoon mushroom mixture over grilled bread.",

            "instructions_full": "For the ribs, stir together the sugar, salt, smoked paprika, chili powder, regular paprika, onion powder, black pepper and thyme. Set aside.\nWith a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)\nSpread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.\nFire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300\u00b0F (120 to 150\u00b0C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.\nDrain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.\nPlace the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300\u00b0F (120 and 150\u00b0C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.\nOnce the ribs are on, it\u2019s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don\u2019t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.\nThe first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. I like to tent my ribs before serving, so take them off the grill and let them rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes.",

Stir to combine, then cover and simmer until the aromatics are completely softened and the liquid thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.\nTransfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Stir in the orange juice and season with more salt to taste. Transfer the hot sauce to a resealable glass jar and refrigerate until ready to use. (The hot sauce will keep for up to 2 weeks.)\nMake the lime sour cream: In a medium bowl, stir together the sour cream, lime zest and juice, and salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nMake the plantains: Fill a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot about two-thirds of the way with vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 375\u00b0F.\nWith a very sharp knife, peel the plantains, then slice lengthwise about \u215b inch thick. Working in batches, fry the plantains in the hot oil, flipping occasionally, until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain. Season with salt and pepper.\nServe the fried plantains with the mango hot sauce and lime sour cream for dipping.",

            "instructions_full": "To make the cake: Set the oven to 350\u00b0F and adjust the rack positions to the middle and top third. Spray three 8-inch round cake pans well with baking spray.\nSift the flour with the baking soda.\nIn a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs well, then beat in the sugar, oil, and vinegar. On low speed, slowly add the flour and beat in well. Add the buttermilk slowly, then the vanilla, and then the food coloring.\nPour the batter evenly into the pans and rap them on the countertop several times to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pans from shelf to shelf so they bake evenly and bake until the tops spring back when lightly touched, about 25 minutes altogether. Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 15 minutes.\nRun a knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely. Once they\u2019re cool, refrigerate the cakes for 20 to 30 minutes to make icing them easier.\nTo make the icing: Combine everything in a medium bowl and mix well until very smooth. It\u2019s best to use the icing right away, when it\u2019s soft and spreadable.\nPut one cake layer upside down on a cake plate or cake stand and cover the top evenly with frosting. Add a second layer, right side up, and spread with more frosting. Top with the third layer, right side up, and spread the frosting evenly around the sides of the cake and on top; check for any places where you can see through to the cake. Finally, sprinkle the pecans evenly all over the top of the cake.\nOnce the frosting sets, cut into slices to serve. This cake keeps for up to 2 weeks in a cake keeper, but once it\u2019s ready, people want to dive right in.",

            "instructions_full": "To make the strawberries, toss the coined berries and cane sugar together in a bowl. Let them sit for about 20 minutes, or until they start to break down and liquefy.\nPreheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C or gas mark 8) and have a sheet pan lined with parchment nearby.\nTo make the biscuits, in a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt. Drizzle over the olive oil, and gently toss with your hands until droplets of oil are dispersed evenly throughout the flour. Add the buttermilk, stirring gently and compressing with your hands until a shaggy dough is formed. Dump out onto a floured work surface and knead until it comes together into a solid mass. Roll it out into a 1\u00bc-inch (3-cm)-thick disk. Using a 3-inch (7.5-cm) biscuit cutter, punch out 6 biscuits, folding and re-rolling the dough if needed. Place the biscuits on the lined sheet tray, brush with more buttermilk, sprinkle with raw sugar if using, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until slightly puffed and golden brown. Remove the biscuits and transfer to a wire rack to cool.\nTo make the balsamic glaze, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey in a saucepan and bring it to a simmer. Cook over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid reduces by half. Set aside to cool and thicken.\nTo make the whipped cream topping, when you\u2019re ready to serve, beat together the cream and honey in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, or in a bowl with an electric mixer, until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Split the cooled biscuits in half and spoon on some of the strawberries along with some of their juices so it soaks into the bottom biscuit. Top with a dollop of whipped cream, followed by a drizzle of the balsamic glaze. Top with the other half of the biscuit, and repeat with more strawberries, more cream, and another drizzle of glaze. Repeat with the rest of the biscuits, and serve immediately.",

Add the butter and pulse a few more times until the mixture is coarse but the butter pieces are still visible. Slowly add the ice water and pulse to form a dough, six to eight pulses. If the dough looks and feels very dry, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough in half and wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap; flatten each piece into a disc. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.\nMake the filling: In a large bowl, mix together the peaches, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00baF.\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and cut in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll it into a 9 x 13-inch rectangle, about \u00bc inch thick. Set aside and repeat with the second piece of dough.\nLine a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with one of the dough rectangles, pressing any excess dough against the sides of the dish. Pour in the peach filling and spread it evenly. Place the second rectangle of dough on top of the peaches and tuck the excess dough into corners. Brush the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Pierce the top with the tip of a sharp knife in several places to allow steam to escape while baking. Bake until the top crust is golden brown, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let cool on a rack before serving. Serve with ice cream.",

Liberally prepare 3 9-inch round pans with the nonstick method of your choice.\nIn the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, cream together the granulated sugar and butter on medium-high speed until nice and fluffy, about 6 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place the strawberries in your food processor and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Set aside.\nWith your stand mixer running, add the eggs 1 at a time, combining well after each addition and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.\nChange your mixer speed to medium-low and add the strawberry pur\u00e9e slowly into the batter. Continue mixing while you tend to the dry ingredients.\nIn a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Slowly add \u00bd of the flour mixture to your stand mixer bowl. Continue to mix on low speed to combine.\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and oil and add to your stand mixer bowl.\nPour in the remaining flour mixture and continue to mix on low until well incorporated. Add the vanilla extract, strawberry extract, and food coloring, if using. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix the batter until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.\nEvenly pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 23 to 28 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a layer comes out clean.\nLet the layers cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks. Let cool to room temperature. Lightly cover the layers with foil or plastic wrap so they do not dry out.\nClean your stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment. Beat the cream cheese on high speed until it begins to thicken and become fluffy.\nTurn your mixer down to low speed and carefully add the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Once the sugar is fully incorporated, turn your mixer speed back to high and continue whipping.\nAdd the heavy cream; vanilla extract; coconut extract, if using; and salt and continue to mix until a smooth, light, and fluffy frosting is achieved.\nOnce the layers are completely cooled, place 1 layer on a serving plate. Spread just the top of the layer with \u2153 of the frosting. Add the second layer and spread with another \u2153 of the frosting. Add the final layer, bottom-side up, and spread with the remaining frosting. Frost the top and the side of the cake. Gently pat the side and the top of the cake with coconut flakes. Serve at room temperature.",

Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again, then beat in the buttermilk and vanilla.\nGradually add the flour mixture, beating just until smooth and well blended. Divide the dough in half. Flatten each half into a disc. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until chilled and slightly stiff, at least 1 hour, but overnight ideally.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\nOn a lightly floured surface, working with one portion at a time, roll the dough to a \u00bc-inch thickness. Cut with a floured 1\u00bd-inch round biscuit cutter. Gather the scraps, reroll, and cut again. Sprinkle lightly with demerara sugar. Transfer the tea cakes to the baking sheets and space them about 1 inch apart.\nBake until the tea cakes are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the pan for 1 minute, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. The tea cakes will keep for about 2 weeks in an airtight container.",

At the same time, soak 3-4 cups of wood chunks in cold water and then drain.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat, then cook the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes. Add the ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, chili powder, and cayenne pepper, then reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\nPreheat grill to high. Place the wood chips in a smoker box or vented foil pouch and heat until they begin to smoke. Turn the heat down to medium. When your grill is about 250 degrees, place the pork on the grill and cook until it is fork-tender and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees, about 5-6 hours. Rotate the meat every 45 minutes.\nTransfer the pork to a rimmed baking sheet. When cool enough to handle, use two large forks to shred the meat into bite-size pieces. Mound the meat onto a platter and toss with 1 cup of the barbecue sauce. Serve the remaining sauce with the buns of your choice.",

Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.\nTo make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it\u2019s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.\nTo make the pur\u00e9e, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to use it.\nTo make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn\u2019t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C). If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.\nRemove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don\u2019t panic\u2014this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.\nUnwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don\u2019t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it\u2019s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry pur\u00e9e on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.\nFrost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I\u2019ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).",

            "instructions_full": "To make the jerk marinade: In a medium bowl, combine the onion, soy sauce, oil, vinegar, water, and jalape\u00f1o. (To make ahead, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)\nTo make the habanero vinegar: In a food processor, com\u00acbine the habanero chile and vinegar and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Pour into a small bowl. (To make ahead, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 month.)\nTo make the pineapple glaze: In a small saucepan, combine the pineapple juice and brown sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until sauce is thick and reduced to about one-third, about 15 minutes. (To make ahead, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)\nTo make the pineapple salsa: In a medium bowl, combine the pineapple, onion, jalape\u00f1os, bell pepper, cilantro, oil, and lime juice. Season with salt. (To make ahead, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 8 hours.)\nTo make the jerk spice rub: In a small bowl, combine the garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, salt, nutmeg, chile powder, cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper in a small bowl.\nUse a butter knife to pry the membrane off the bone side of the ribs. Once you get a piece of the membrane loose, grab it with a paper towel and pull it toward the other end of the slab to remove it. Rub the Jerk Spice Rub evenly over the ribs. Arrange the ribs in a 15-by-10-in/38-by-25-cm baking pan. Pour the Jerk Marinade over the ribs, turning to coat both sides. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.\nRemove ribs from marinade, letting the excess drip off. Transfer the ribs to a baking sheet and allow to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Brush with the Habanero Vinegar.\nTo cook ribs using a charcoal grill: Prepare grill for indirect cooking over medium heat. Place a shallow metal pan filled with water in the center of the grill and arrange the hot coals around it. Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the ribs on the grate directly above the water-filled pan, cover the grill, and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add coals as needed to maintain medium heat.\nTo cook ribs using a gas grill: Preheat the grill with all the burners on high. Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the ribs on the grate, turn off the burner directly under the ribs, and reduce the other burners to medium heat. Cover the grill and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nAfter 45 minutes, brush the ribs with some of the Pineapple Glaze, and brush them two or three times before serving. Do not flip the ribs during cooking. When the ribs are done, they will be well browned and the meat will have shrunk back from the ends of the bones. Transfer ribs to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes before cutting rack into individual ribs. Serve warm with the Pineapple Salsa.",

Generously coat nine wells of a standard muffin tin with coconut oil.\nPut the dates in a small heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Let soak for about 5 minutes. Drain the dates, reserving the soaking liquid, and transfer them to a food processor. Add 1 tablespoon of the reserved soaking liquid and process, scraping down the sides and adding more of the reserved soaking liquid if necessary, until mostly creamy but with a few chunks remaining.\nPlace the prepared muffin tin in the oven to heat for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until blended.\nPut the flaxseeds and 6 tablespoons water in a medium bowl and whisk until well blended. Whisk in the pureed dates and the coconut oil until smooth. Whisk in the oat milk until well combined. Add the oat milk mixture to the cornmeal mixture and stir until just combined.\nWhen the muffin tin is hot, remove it from the oven and immediately scrape the batter into the prepared muffin cups, distributing it evenly among them (they should be a little over three-quarters full).\nBake until the muffins are golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool in the tin for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool a bit more.\nMake the whipped sweet corn: While the muffins are cooling, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9, stirring often, until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the corn, sugar, and salt and cook, stirring often, until the corn is just tender, about 5 minutes.\nScrape the contents of the skillet into a food processor. Add the cashew cream and process until silky smooth, adding water as necessary to reach the desired consistency. Taste and season with lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl. Serve the warm muffins slathered with whipped sweet corn and topped with pepper jelly.",

Add dry ingredients to egg mixture with a spoon or rubber spatula until dough comes together and is smooth with no spots of dry flour remaining.\nTurn out dough onto a well-floured large sheet of parchment or wax paper (you can be generous with the flour since you\u2019ll brush off the excess later). Dust dough with more flour, place another large sheet of parchment or waxed paper over, and roll to \u00bd\" thick. Remove top sheet of parchment and brush off any excess flour with a dry pastry brush.\nPunch out circles with a 3\u00bd\"-diameter biscuit or cookie cutter, glass, or mug. Punch out centers of rounds with a 1\"-diamter cutter or plastic twist-off bottle cap (or poke a hole with a chopstick, then gently pull hole open to widen the center). Reroll any scraps and punch out additional doughnuts and holes.\nFit a large pot with thermometer; pour in oil to come 1\u00bd\" up the sides of the pot. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F. Fry doughnuts, turning halfway through, until puffy and a color somewhere between golden brown and mahogany, about 4 minutes total (time will be slightly less for doughnut holes). Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a wire rack and let cool 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk lemon zest, powdered sugar, a tiny pinch of salt, and \u00bc cup water in a small bowl until a smooth glaze forms.\nDip each side of doughnuts and holes into glaze, letting excess run off before returning to rack. Eat as soon as you can\u2019t stand the suspense anymore.",

Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes.\nTransfer 2 Tbsp. syrup to a small bowl, add cornstarch, and stir until smooth. Add back to syrup; simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Fish out lemon zest and discard. Squeeze in lemon juice to taste and let cool slightly.\nWhisk flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add yogurt, then melted butter, then egg to well. Using a fork, stir together wet ingredients, then mix, incorporating dry ingredients a little at a time, until a lumpy batter forms.\nHeat waffle iron on medium-low. Lightly coat with nonstick spray and pour a heaping \u00bd cup batter onto iron (or up to 2 cups if using a larger one). Cook until waffles are golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. (Keep warm on a baking sheet in a 300\u00b0 oven if desired.) Repeat with remaining batter, coating iron with more nonstick spray as needed. Serve with butter and warm syrup.",

Scatter crumble over a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, trying not to break it up too much, and bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, toss strawberries, lemon juice, cardamom, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl to combine.\nHeat honey in a small skillet, stirring, until it begins to bubble and darkens slightly, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and scrape into strawberries. Toss, until honey is evenly distributed (it\u2019ll be sticky in the beginning but will eventually dissolve). Let sit, tossing occasionally, until berries release their juices, about 15 minutes.\nScoop ice cream into bowls. Spoon strawberries and their juices over; scatter crumble on top.",

Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let sit in a warm, dry spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nWhile the dough is rising, toast coriander seeds and cumin seeds in a dry medium skillet over medium heat, shaking often, until fragrant and slightly darkened in color, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill. Let cool, then coarsely grind. Set spice mixture aside.\nPlace scallions and 1 Tbsp. oil in skillet, season with kosher salt, and cook, turning occasionally, until softened and deeply charred, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; trim roots and discard. Finely chop scallions and place in a medium bowl. Add reserved spice mixture, chile, and parsley. Finely grate half of lemon zest into bowl, then cut lemon in half and squeeze in juice. Add 1 cup oil and stir well to combine. Season with kosher salt and let sit while you make the flatbreads.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly dusted surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Form into balls and, working with 1 ball at a time, roll out into 6\" rounds about \u00bc\" thick.\nHeat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working 1 at a time and adding remaining 2 Tbsp. oil as needed, cook flatbread until bubbles appear over the surface, about 1 minute. Flip and cook until cooked through, about 1 minute. Continue to cook, turning often, until browned in spots on both sides, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to a plate and wrap up in a clean kitchen towel to keep warm.\nTo serve, brush each flatbread with oil. Coarsely smash avocados onto flatbread and spoon salsa over.

Prick the pastry base all over with a fork and bake for 20 minutes or until light golden.\nWhile the tart shell is baking, place the ricotta, lemon zest, Parmesan, salt and pepper in a large bowl and mix to combine.\nAllow the tart shell to cool completely before carefully lifting it from the tin. Place on a serving plate and fill with the ricotta mixture. Top the tart with the tomato and basil. Drizzle with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and slice into wedges to serve.",

Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you\u2019ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the \u00bd tablespoon until it appears just moistened\u2014a dough that\u2019s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.\nUsing the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.\nPlace the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, rotating 90 degrees after each roll, and adding a bit more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Drape the rolled dough over a rolling pin and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a clean rim of about an inch, and pile the fruit on top. Fold the crust around over the fruit, pleating rustically as you go. Brush the exposed pastry with water, then sprinkle generously\u2014over the crust and the fruit, too\u2014with sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake until the fruit juices are bubbling in the center and the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes, or more depending on the fruit.\nServe warm, with fresh whipped cream or ice cream, or cold, perhaps for breakfast, with yogurt.",

Gather it up in your hands and squeeze out as much moisture as you can.\nPreheat the oven 375\u00b0F. Generously grease an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.\nWhisk together the flour, baking powder, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, the sugar, and black pepper. Add the zucchini, scallions, coarsely shredded cheese, and 1/4 cup of the olive oil, folding to combine, then pour in the beer. Let stand for a few minutes as the dry ingredients absorb the beer, then fold gently until everything is moistened. It\u2019ll be a dense and tacky batter. Scrape into the prepared pan.\nDrizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with the finely shredded cheese. Transfer to the oven and bake until set in the center and a tester comes out clean, 75 to 80 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then unmold. This bread can be served warm (though it\u2019ll be a bit gooey inside) and should be eaten within a day or two, stored loosely covered at room temperature.",

(This is optional but results in softer, more evenly cooked rice.) Drain thoroughly using a fine-mesh sieve.\nIn a soup pot, dry-roast and stir the lentils continuously over medium heat until they are golden brown and have a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. (This step is optional but reduces the stickiness of the dal.) Thoroughly wash the lentils using a fine mesh colander. Return them to the pot, together with the rice, and add 3 1\u20442 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Skim the foam off the top. Add the turmeric powder, 2 tablespoons of the ghee, and the ginger to the boiling mixture.\nWhile the rice and lentils are cooking, put 1\u20442 teaspoon of the ghee in a tempering pot or small pan over medium heat. Add the cashews, stirring them until they are fragrant and turn golden brown, a few minutes. Set the cashews aside to cool in a bowl lined with a paper towel. If using cumin seeds and peppercorns, roughly crush them in a mortar with a pestle. Set aside.\nWhen the rice and lentil mixture is cooked, mix in the salt, coconut, and fried cashews, reserving some cashews for garnish.\nPut the remaining 2 tablespoons of ghee in the tempering pot or small pan over medium heat. When melted, add the crushed black peppercorns and cumin seeds and the asafetida. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Turn off the heat.\nImmediately pour the spiced ghee over the rice. To get all of the spiced ghee out of the pot, put a spoonful of the rice mixture into the pot, stir, and spoon it back into the rest of the dish. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Garnish with the reserved cashews. Serve hot.",

(They will let off quite a bit of liquid; this is okay.)\nTransfer the contents of the food processor to a 4-quart stainless-steel or enameled Dutch oven. Add the sugar and vinegar and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, stirring continuously. Boil, still stirring, for 3 minutes, then squeeze in the pectin. Return the mixture to a rolling boil, stirring continuously, and cook for 1 minute. Immediately remove from the heat and let rest until the foam has settled, about 1 minute. Skim off and discard any remaining foam.\nSpoon the jelly into the sterilized jars and let cool for 1 hour. Seal the jars and refrigerate until chilled before using. The jelly will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 months and up to 2 years if processed in a hot water bath and kept in a cool, dry place.",

Bring dates, baking soda, and \u00be cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Let cool.\nSift flour into a medium bowl; mix in baking powder and salt. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat granulated sugar, vanilla, and remaining 6 Tbsp. butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition; beat until mixture is very light and airy, about 3 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low; add half of dry ingredients and beat just until incorporated. Mix in cooled date mixture, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat until just combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface to make an even layer.\nBake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25\u201330 minutes.\nWhile the cake bakes, make the glaze. Slice each date in half lengthwise, then thinly slice each half into strips. Place in a small bowl and pour in \u00bd cup boiling water to cover; let soak.\nCook cream, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally and breaking up sugar as needed, until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Bring just to a simmer and cook, stirring, until glaze thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Let cool until glaze thickens further but is still pourable, about 15 minutes.\nRemove cake from springform pan and slide onto a platter or large plate. Arrange drained date strips along edge of cake so they look like spokes on a wheel. Carefully drizzle warm glaze over cake, so it drips over the edges. Let cool completely before serving.",

Set over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 1 hour, stirring the beans on a regular basis. The level of liquid will reduce as the beans cook; once it gets to the point where it does not completely cover the beans, you will need to stir more often to ensure that the beans cook evenly. After an hour, the beans should be tender but still retain a little bite. If they are still hard, add more dashi or water and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer, until the beans are tender with a little bite.\nAdd the sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds to the pot and mix well. (It\u2019s important to wait to add the sugar until the beans are tender, as adding it in the beginning will cause the beans to harden when refrigerated.) Let the beans cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled. (The beans will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.)\nServe the beans cold with hot rice.",

            "instructions_full": "Stir yeast, sugar, and 1\u00bc cups warm (not hot) water in the bowl of a stand mixer until yeast dissolves. Let sit until mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.\nAdd whole wheat flour, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil to yeast mixture and mix to combine. Fit mixer with dough hook and, with mixer on low speed, gradually add 3 cups (375 g) bread flour, mixing until a shaggy dough forms, about 4 minutes from when you start adding the flour. Stop mixer and scrape down sides of bowl to incorporate any dry bits into dough. Increase mixer speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and shiny, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to bring together. Shape into a ball, place in a large lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover bowl and let dough sit in warm draft-free spot until doubled in size, 1\u20131\u00bd hours. Make your toppings while your dough is rising.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until skins start to blister and split, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and toss to coat. Cook, lightly pressing on tomatoes with spoon to release juices without smashing completely, until garlic is softened, about 2 minutes. Mix oregano into sauce; taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed.\nDo ahead: Sauce can be made 4 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and stir to combine before using.\nCut Swiss chard leaves away from ribs and stems, then cut crosswise into 3\"-wide strips. Trim away woody part from stems; discard. Finely chop ribs and stems.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add ribs and stems and season with salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they release some liquid, look slightly shriveled, and are a shade or two darker, about 5 minutes. Add leaves and red pepper flakes and toss to coat. Season with more salt and black pepper and reduce heat to medium. Cook, tossing occasionally, until leaves are bright green, wilted, and tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer chard mixture to a medium bowl and let cool slightly.\nFinely grate garlic into bowl with chard mixture, then finely grate in zest from lemon; mix well. Add Parmesan and mix again to combine. Taste and season with more salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes, if needed.\nDo ahead: Chard mixture can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill. Bring to room temperature and stir to combine before using.\nPur\u00e9e tomatoes in a blender on low speed (or use an immersion blender if you have one) until smooth (try not to aerate it too much). Transfer sauce to a medium bowl and stir in oil and salt.\nDo ahead: Passata can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill, or freeze up to 6 months.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Clean grate. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 pieces. Working one at a time, gently shape into balls. Transfer to a lightly floured small rimmed baking sheet and cover. Let sit 20\u201330 minutes.\nPlace a ball of dough on a lightly floured surface (keep remaining balls covered) and, using your fingers, press out to an 8\" round. Drape dough over the backs of your hands and gently pull and stretch, rotating dough as you go, until about 12\" in diameter (it\u2019s okay if it\u2019s not a perfect circle).\nBrush dough with oil. Place, oiled side down, on grill over direct heat and cook until large bubbles appear across surface, dough stiffens, and underside is dark brown, about 2 minutes. Brush top with oil, turn over, and cook just to lightly dry out second side, about 30 seconds.\nUsing tongs and a metal spatula, move dough over to cooler side of grill. Top with a spoonful of passata or burst cherry tomatoes and one quarter of cheese (either alone or in combination). Add pepperoni or salami (if using), then some of the lemony Swiss chard, and/or Rosemary Agrodolce as desired. Carefully slide pizza back over direct heat. Cook until cheese is melted and toppings are heated through, about 2 minutes. If dough is in danger of burning on underside but toppings need more time, return pizza to cooler side, cover grill, and cook another 1\u20132 minutes.\nTransfer pizza to a cutting board and drizzle with more oil. Top with basil and red pepper flakes if desired.\nRepeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas.",

Cook, stirring, until pork is crisp and mixture is very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add wine and soy sauce and return asparagus to skillet.

If chilling, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0F. Coarsely chop 4 green garlic stalks; transfer to a food processor. Pulse until very finely chopped. Add zest and butter and pulse until almost smooth. Cut remaining 4 green garlic stalks in half lengthwise; set aside.\nPat chicken dry again with paper towels (this will help the butter adhere and get the skin nicely browned). Smear garlic butter all over chicken. Gently lift the skin on the breast away from the flesh and rub some butter inside.\nToss reserved green garlic and oil in a large cast-iron skillet or 13x9\" baking dish to coat; season with salt. Tie chicken legs together with kitchen twine and tuck wings underneath back. Place chicken, breast side up, on top of garlic in skillet.\nRoast chicken, rotating pan halfway through for even browning, until skin is golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F (don\u2019t worry; temperature will climb to 165\u00b0F as the chicken rests), 80\u201390 minutes.

Fold in scallions.\nHeat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. Pour \u00bc cup batter into skillet. Cook, moving pan around on the burner for even cooking, until bottom of pancake is set and golden, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook, pressing down on pancake to create direct contact with pan, until other side is golden, about 1 minute. Continue cooking, turning often to keep scallions from burning, until golden brown and crisp and cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer pancake to a wire rack. Repeat process with remaining batter and remaining 3 Tbsp. oil 3 more times to make a total of 4 pancakes.\nCut each pancake into wedges if desired and serve with reserved sauce on the side for dipping.",

Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Place cream cheese in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water). Heat cream cheese, stirring occasionally, until very soft, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat (leave water simmering). Using a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon, smash and mix cream cheese until smooth. Add 1 egg, \u2153 cup (66 g) sugar, \u00bd tsp. vanilla, and \u00bc tsp. salt and whisk until very smooth. Transfer about half of cream cheese mixture to a small bowl and whisk in 1\u00bd tsp. cocoa powder.\nPlace butter in another medium heatproof bowl. Add espresso powder (if using) and remaining 1 cup (200 g) sugar, \u00be cup plus 2 Tbsp. cocoa powder, and \u00bd tsp. salt. Place bowl over saucepan of still simmering water and cook, stirring occasionally once the butter starts to melt, until mixture is homogeneous and too hot to leave your finger in, 7\u20139 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.\nAdd remaining 2 eggs and remaining \u00bd tsp. vanilla to butter mixture one at a time, whisking vigorously after each addition until smooth and glossy. Add flour and mix with spatula or spoon until no longer visible, then vigorously mix another 30 strokes. Scoop out \u00bd cup brownie batter and set aside. Scrape remaining batter into prepared pan and spread into an even layer.\nWorking quickly, alternate dollops of cocoa\u2013cream cheese mixture and cream cheese mixture over batter. Dollop reserved batter on top (it will be quite thick). Don\u2019t worry if your design looks random and spotted.\nBake brownies until center is set and no longer looks wet, 22\u201325 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool. Using parchment paper overhang, lift brownies out of pan and transfer to a cutting board.

Add chilled butter and toss to coat. Using your hands, work butter into dry ingredients until there are lots of flat pieces and pea-size bits. Add scallions and toss to evenly distribute.\nCreate a well in the center of mixture and add 1\u00bc cups sour cream into the center. Using a fork and working in circles, mix until large shaggy clumps form. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice until it comes together (flour your hands if needed). If there are any loose bits, add them to center of dough and knead once more to incorporate. Pat dough into an 8x4\" rectangle about 1\" thick.\nWorking from a short side, fold dough in thirds as you would a letter. It doesn\u2019t need to overlap perfectly. Pat dough into another 8x4\" rectangle, then fold dough in thirds like a letter one more time. Pat dough back into an 8x4\" rectangle and cut in half lengthwise. Cut each half crosswise into 4 squares for a total of 8 biscuits.\nTransfer biscuits to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush tops gently with melted butter; sprinkle with sea salt. Bake biscuits until golden brown, 18\u201322 minutes. Serve warm with sour cream (or more butter!) for slathering.",

            "instructions_full": "Heat butter in a small saucepan over the lowest heat possible until melted (you don\u2019t want it to sputter or brown), about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and 1\u00bc tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00be tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl.\nScrape butter into a large bowl and add brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk vigorously until butter is absorbed into sugar, about 30 seconds. Add egg, then egg yolks, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition; whisk in vanilla. Mixture should look much lighter in color and be almost creamy.\nAdd dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir until just incorporated and almost no dry streaks remain. Set aside a handful of chocolate, then add remaining chocolate to batter. Gently mix just to evenly distribute. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel (a silicone lid or plastic wrap also works) and chill 2 hours.\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using a tablespoon, scoop out 2-Tbsp. portions of dough (or, if you have one, this is a leveled-off #30 cookie scoop or a heaping #40) and place 5 on each baking sheet, spacing evenly. Roll into balls and gently press 2\u20133 pieces of reserved chocolate onto the top of each one. It\u2019s okay to jam the chocolate on there\u2014some pieces can even be vertical. Cover and chill any remaining dough.\nBake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are golden brown and centers are puffed, 8\u201310 minutes.\nWorking one at a time, pull baking sheets out of the oven and tap lightly on the stove to deflate cookies. Sprinkle with Diamond Crystal kosher salt (if you\u2019re using Morton, skip it: the crystals are too large). Let cookies cool on baking sheets 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.\nLet baking sheets cool, then turn parchment paper over. Repeat process with remaining dough, dividing evenly between baking sheets, to make 6\u20138 more cookies.\nDo Ahead: Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Let cool; store airtight at room temperature.",

            "instructions_full": "Combine buttermilk and 6 Tbsp. oil in a small microwave-safe bowl (it won\u2019t get smooth and that\u2019s okay) and heat in the microwave in three 10-second bursts until just about body temperature (it shouldn\u2019t feel hot or cold to the touch); an instant-read thermometer will register about 98\u00b0F. (Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)\nWhisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.\nPulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.\nUsing a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.\nRoll out dough into a rough 8\" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4\" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4\" square. Roll dough back out to an 8\" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4\" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.\nPlace dates in a small bowl and pour in 1\u00bd cups hot water to cover. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes.\nDrain dates and transfer to a food processor; discard soaking liquid. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Pur\u00e9e, scraping down sides as needed, until smooth, about 4 minutes. (You should have about \u00bd cup pur\u00e9e.)\nGrease a 10\" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8\" square. Fold in half into an 8x4\" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4\" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12\" square about \u00bc\" thick. Dollop date pur\u00e9e all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a \u00bd\" border without pur\u00e9e along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over pur\u00e9e.\nStarting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about \u00bd\" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1\" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.\nCover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until they\u2019re doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1\u20131\u00bd hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.\nMeanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla in a medium bowl to combine.\nBrush glaze over warm buns and serve in skillet.\nDo Ahead: Pur\u00e9e can be made 3 days ahead. Place in an airtight container; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.",

(If you only have 1 muffin pan, you can bake the extra batter in a small loaf pan or mini muffin pan, or just discard it.) Generously coat pan with sugar, tapping out excess (about \u00bc cup should do it).\nPlace 1\u00bd cups (300 g) sugar and 6 Tbsp. butter in a large bowl. If using coconut milk, heat in a small saucepan over medium, whisking constantly, until no clumps remain, then whisk into sugar mixture. If using half-and-half, whisk directly into sugar mixture. Add eggs, vanilla, and salt and whisk to combine.\nWhisk rice flour, powdered flavoring of choice (or 3 Tbsp. more rice flour), spice of choice, and baking powder in a medium bowl to combine, then whisk into egg mixture. Scrape batter into prepared pan and sprinkle with coconut or sesame seeds.\nBake until top begins to crack and cake springs back when gently pressed, 55\u201365 minutes for cake and 45\u201355 minutes for cupcakes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 10 minutes. Run a knife around perimeter of cake, place a plate over pan, and invert cake onto plate. Hold wire rack over cake and invert cake onto rack (simply turn cupcakes out onto rack and turn over). Let cool completely.\nDo ahead: Cake can be baked 5 days ahead.

Using your hands and working quickly, rub and smash butter into flat, irregular pieces (be careful not to overwork; you don\u2019t want to soften the butter too much).1 Drizzle \u2153 cup cold water over and mix with a rubber spatula, smashing in butter, until dough mostly comes together\u2014it will be dry and shaggy.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly and using a rolling pin and your hands, press dough together to form a mass. Roll dough into a rough square about \u00bd\" thick. Fold in half into a rectangle, then once again to make a small square. Press down on the dough with rolling pin to make it hold together. Roll dough out once more to make a rough square about \u00bd\" thick. Repeat folding process, taking your time to make it neat as this will be your final fold. Using rolling pin, gently flatten dough, rotating as needed, to make a 6\"-diameter disk.\nDust surface with more flour and roll disk into a 14\"-diameter circle or oval about \u215b\" thick. Fold dough in half, then in half again to make a rough triangle (this will make it easier to move). Slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and unfold. Chill while you make the filling.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap 6\" disk tightly and chill until ready to roll out.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375\u00b0F. Heat 3 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium until foaming, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; add onion, garlic, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bd tsp. Morton salt, and stir to combine. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender and just beginning to brown, 6\u20138 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and adding a splash of water if onion begins to stick, until golden brown in spots, about 5 minutes more. Transfer onion mixture to a plate; reserve skillet.\nMelt remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in reserved skillet (no need to wipe out) over medium heat. Remove from heat and add scallions and remaining \u00bd tsp. Diamond Crystal or \u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt. Toss scallions until coated in butter.\nRemove dough from refrigerator and, using a small offset spatula or a spoon, spread mustard in a thin layer over dough, leaving a 1\u00bd\"\u20132\" border around the edges. Scatter onion mixture over mustard and sprinkle with Parmesan; season with pepper. Cutting from edge of dough to the start of the mustard and filling, make slits in border of galette at 2\"\u20133\" intervals. Fold flaps up and over filling, slightly overlapping. Scatter scallions over. Bake galette until crust is deep golden brown and scallions are lightly charred, 45\u201350 minutes. Using parchment paper, slide galette onto a cutting board and cut into wedges.\nDo Ahead: Onion can be cooked 3 days ahead; transfer to an airtight container, then cover and chill. Galette can be assembled 1 hour ahead; chill.",

Add flour and salt; mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.\nPour 4 Tbsp. oil into the biggest bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.\nGenerously butter a 13x9\" baking pan (for thicker focaccia that\u2019s perfect for sandwiches) or an 18x13\" rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (Using a fork in each hand makes this process even easier and less messy!)\nTransfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over the dough and coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1\u00bd hours and up to 4 hours. To see if it\u2019s ready, poke the dough with your finger. The dough should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn\u2019t ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren\u2019t, you can chill it up to 1 hour.)\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F. Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you may not need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, as if you\u2019re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20\u201330 minutes.\nMelt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and grate in garlic (use 2 cloves if you\u2019re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, about 45 seconds. Brush garlic butter all over focaccia. If you don\u2019t want to serve the focaccia immediately, hold off on brushing so it remains crisp.",

Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Whisk flour, powdered sugar, sesame seeds, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Using your hands, work in butter until pieces are about pea-size. Using a rubber spatula, mix in yolks.

Prick dough with a fork in several spots (this will help it stay flat as it bakes).\nBake shortbread until golden brown, 24\u201328 minutes (or up to 35 minutes if using a glass dish). Let cool slightly.\nWhile the shortbread is cooling, heat brown sugar and butter, whisking constantly, in a heavy medium saucepan over medium until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, whisking constantly, until butterscotch is thick enough to coat a spoon (bubbling will become less frequent), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add tahini and vanilla and whisk until incorporated and smooth.\nPour butterscotch over shortbread and tilt pan to distribute evenly. Chill until set, 30\u201340 minutes.\nMelt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave in 40-second increments, stirring between bursts. (Alternatively, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water; bowl should not touch water. Heat, stirring often, until melted and smooth.) Pour over butterscotch and spread evenly to edges of pan; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Chill until chocolate is firm, 1\u20132 hours.\nUsing parchment paper overhang, pull bars out of pan and set on a cutting board; remove parchment. Using a serrated knife, slice into 25\u201336 pieces (5\u20136 cuts in each direction). Bring to room temperature before serving.\nDo Ahead: Bars can be made 4 days ahead.

Place a wire rack on top of a large baking sheet, coat with cooking spray, and set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the coconut and paprika and season with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with 1 tablespoon water.\nMake an assembly line with the shrimp, egg wash, coconut mixture, and prepared baking sheet. Dip the shrimp in the egg wash, then dredge in the coconut, lightly shaking off any excess, then place the coated shrimp on the baking rack. Repeat with the remaining shrimp, spacing them out evenly on the baking rack so they will get crispy instead of steaming.\nBake for 12 to 14 minutes, until the shrimp are cooked through and the coconut has started to brown.\nWhile the shrimp are cooking, make the salsa and sauce. In a medium bowl, toss together the salsa ingredients and set aside.\nIn a food processor or high-powered blender, add the sauce ingredients and \u2153 cup water. Pulse until smooth, adjusting the seasonings to your taste. If desired, spoon the sauce into a small zip-top bag and cut the tip off of one of the bottom corners (like you would to make a piping bag for icing), just enough to make a small hole. This will make it easier to drizzle your sauce more evenly, but you could also just use a spoon.\nTo assemble the tacos, place 3 to 4 shrimp on a tortilla or lettuce cup, top with shredded cabbage, a spoonful of salsa, and an avocado slice. Pipe or drizzle the sauce over the top.",

Rub the spice mixture evenly over the ribs. Arrange the ribs on the trivet.\nSecure the lid on the pot and close the pressure-release valve. Set the pot to HIGH pressure for 25 minutes. At the end of the cooking time, use a natural release to depressurize.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the coconut aminos, butter, sesame oil, lime zest, and remaining 2 tablespoons lime juice. Cook the sauce over medium-low heat just until the butter melts, about 2 minutes.\nAdjust an oven rack to 6 inches from the heat source. Preheat the broiler. Line a large baking sheet with foil.\nOpen the Instant Pot and transfer the ribs, meaty-side down, to the prepared baking sheet (discard the cooking liquid from the pot). Brush the ribs with some of the sauce. Broil until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the ribs over. Brush with more sauce. Broil until browned and slightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes more.\nIn a small bowl, toss together all ingredients for the slaw.\nTo serve, brush the ribs with any remaining sauce and sprinkle with the green onion and sesame seeds.

You will need a loaf pan measuring about 8\u00bd x 4\u00bd x 2\u00be inches, or one with about a 6\u2011cup capacity. Butter the pan and dust it all over lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs, shake out excess crumbs, and set the pan aside.\nSift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa, and sugar and set aside.\nBeat the cream and vanilla in the small bowl of an electric mixer until the cream holds a definite shape. On low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until the egg is incorporated after each addition. (The eggs will thin the cream slightly.)\nTransfer to the large bowl of the mixer and gradually, on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl and beating only until smooth. Remove from the mixer and stir in the grated zest. That\u2019s all there is to it.\nTurn the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for about 1 hour and 5 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly pressed with a fingertip.\nAs soon as the cake goes into the oven, mix the orange juice with the sugar and let it stand while the cake is baking.\nAfter you remove the cake from the oven, let it cool for 5 minutes. Then, a little at a time, brush the orange juice/sugar mixture all over the cake; encourage most of it to run down the sides between the cake and the pan, but thoroughly wet the top also. The cake will absorb it all.\nLet the cake stand in the pan until it is completely cool. Then cover the pan loosely with a piece of wax paper. Invert the cake into the palm of your hand\u2014easy does it\u2014remove the pan, cover the cake with a rack, and invert again, leaving the cake right side up.",

The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it.\nDetach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears. Add the rest of the flour mixture and continue folding and mixing until all traces of flour have disappeared. Using a silicone spatula or spoon, scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Run a small metal spatula or dull knife blade through the batter to prevent large air bubbles, avoiding the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small metal spatula.\nBake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted between the tube and the side comes out completely clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.\nLet the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. With a small metal spatula, loosen the top edges of the cake and invert the cake onto a wire rack that has been coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Cool completely. The cake requires no adornment, but I love to serve it with a light dusting of powdered sugar or a large dollop of lightly sweetened Whipped Cream.",

Line bottom of pan with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate any air bubbles.\nGrate carrots on the large holes of a box grater. Measure out 2\u00bd cups (lightly packed; 250 g); reserve remaining carrots for another use (like raita!).\nSet a fine-mesh sieve over a measuring glass and place next to stove. Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add pistachios and cook, stirring often, until butter browns and nuts smell toasty, about 5 minutes. (Butter will get very foamy and it will be hard to see what\u2019s going on, so once the foam is golden brown, remove pan from heat every 10 seconds to check how the nuts are browning.) Pour mixture through prepared sieve, scraping in all of the browned bits; set nuts and butter aside.\nCrack eggs into a large bowl; add brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 3 minutes (mixture should be thick, pale, and increased in volume). Decrease speed to medium-high and gradually stream in reserved brown butter (including browned bits); beat until combined. Coarsely chop reserved pistachios. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour until almost completely combined, then add nuts and carrots and continue to fold until everything is incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Place pan on a clean smooth surface and give it a fast 360-degree spin (this pushes the batter up the sides of the pan and minimizes doming during baking).\nBake cake until deeply browned and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50\u201355 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a small offset spatula or butter knife around perimeter of cake to loosen. Place a plate upside down over cake and invert cake onto plate (leave flat side up). Remove parchment paper.\nDo Ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\nPlace a small plate in the freezer. Cook carrot juice, cream, granulated sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat (do not stir) until thick like lava, 8\u201310 minutes. Mixture will initially bubble and foam vigorously and look like it\u2019s going to boil over, but it won\u2019t! Don\u2019t be tempted to reduce the heat; the bubbling will subside and mixture will thicken. You want it to be thick enough to stick to the cake, but do not let it brown. Test glaze by putting a small dollop onto the cold plate: When you run your finger through the glaze, it should leave a defined trail.\nOnce the glaze is thick enough, remove pan from heat and stir in butter. Let cool until you can comfortably hold your finger in it (if it\u2019s too hot, it will run right off the cake), about 15 minutes.\nStir glaze well and pour over center of cake, nudging to the edges with offset spatula or butter knife. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick. Let glaze cool at least 10 minutes before slicing cake.",

Rebottle.\nNote: The recipe for the jalape\u00f1o tequila will vary because not all jalape\u00f1os are equally spicy. You need to taste it frequently to make sure it\u2019s right. Ensure your tequila is not cold, as cold tequila will not infuse properly.\nBlend the watermelon in a blender to yield about 12 ounces of juice. Add the sugar and blend again until fully dissolved. Transfer to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nAdd all the ingredients, except for 1 mint leaf, the lime wheel, and salt, to a cocktail shaker with ice. Wet the outside of a coupe glass with the lime wheel and roll the glass in salt for a salted rim. Shake and fine-strain into the glass.

It will take awhile to work out lumps\u2014a few small lumps are fine, but try to get batter as smooth as possible.\nPour in enough oil to lightly coat a crepe pan or 10\" nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high (this is just to help get things going; you shouldn\u2019t need to add more oil to the pan). Pour \u00bc cup batter into center of pan and tilt and rotate pan as needed to coat bottom evenly with batter. Cook crepe, undisturbed, until surface looks dry and bottom is golden brown, about 45 seconds. Using tongs or an offset spatula, gently flip crepe and cook just until other side is golden, about 20 seconds. Transfer to a plate and slather a bit of room-temperature butter on top. Repeat process with remaining batter, stacking and buttering crepes as you go.\nServe crepes with jam, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, demerara sugar, lox, and/or more butter as desired.\nDo ahead: Crepes can be made 4 days ahead. Wrap tightly and chill, or freeze up to 2 weeks. If frozen, thaw in fridge before reheating. Reheatone at a time in crepe pan or skillet over medium until warmed through.",

            "instructions_full": "Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed, until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks and vanilla and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low, add 2 cups flour, and mix until incorporated. Dough will be semifirm but can be rolled out without chilling. If your kitchen is very warm and/or dough is sticky, pat it into a 1\"-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill 15 minutes to let firm up before rolling out.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with more flour as needed to keep dough from sticking, to about \u00bc\" thick. Punch out shapes as desired with lightly floured cookie cutters and transfer to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1\u00bd\" apart. Pat scraps into a 1\"-thick disk, wrap with plastic, and chill 10 minutes if soft.\nBake 1 sheet of cookies, rotating halfway through, until edges are golden brown, 10\u201315 minutes. Let cookies cool 10 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Bake remaining sheet of cookies, then repeat process with remaining dough.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made 1 month ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.\nWhisk 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. milk, 2 tsp. food-coloring powder, and half of salt in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; add more milk if needed. For a deeper color, whisk in more powder 1 tsp. at a time until desired color is achieved; adjust with milk if needed. Repeat with second food-coloring powder, remaining salt, remaining 1 cup powdered sugar, and remaining 3 Tbsp. milk, adjusting intensity of color as desired.\nSpoon 1 tsp. first glaze in the center of a small plate. Drizzle 1 tsp. second glaze over the first and use a toothpick to slightly swirl colors together; don\u2019t go overboard. (If you want to decorate larger cookies, add 1 tsp. glaze to plate for each additional inch.)\nGently press the top of a cookie into glaze, then lift up and allow excess glaze to drip back onto the plate. Using a toothpick, pop any air bubbles and swirl colors more if desired. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 2 more cookies, adding \u00bd tsp. of each color of glaze to plate before each cookie is dipped. The glaze will lose its swirly effect at this point. Clean plate and repeat process, decorating cookies in batches of 3 until all cookies have been glazed. Let sit until glaze is set, at least 2 hours.\nDo Ahead: Cookies can be glazed 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped on a rimmed baking sheet at room temperature.",

Toast nuts and \u00bc cup sesame seeds on a rimmed baking sheet on upper rack, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool.\nStir together ancho powder and agave syrup in a small bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, and cinnamon in a medium bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed, until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks and vanilla and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Scrape in ancho mixture and beat until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients, and beat to combine. Add dried fruit, chocolate, and toasted nuts and sesame seeds; mix with a wooden spoon until evenly distributed.\nDivide dough in half. Working one at a time, roll each piece into a 10\"-long log. Wrap each log tightly in plastic and roll across work surface to make as smooth and cylindrical as possible. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until surface is firm, about 20 minutes.\nSlap a log down onto counter to create a flat side; roll over and slap again to flatten another side (you\u2019re aiming for a triangular shape). Repeat to create third side of the triangle. Tap against counter to smooth if needed, then tap ends to flatten. Repeat with second log. Return logs to baking sheet; freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.\nWorking one at a time, unwrap logs and brush sides with egg white. Working on baking sheet, sprinkle sides with remaining 1 cup sesame seeds and gently press to coat. Surface should be covered; use more sesame if needed. Freeze logs on baking sheet, uncovered, until surface is very firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Slice a log crosswise into \u00bc\"-thick triangles and divide cookies between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1\" apart. (If dough is soft or starts to lose its shape, freeze 10 minutes before continuing.) Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Transfer cookies to a platter or airtight container and line baking sheets with fresh sheets of parchment paper. Repeat process with remaining dough.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be rolled into logs 3 days ahead; refrigerate. Transfer to freezer 30 minutes before slicing. Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature.",

Drain the plantains, reserving \u00bd cup (125 mL) of the cooking water.\nMeanwhile, place the red onion in a small bowl and cover with the vinegar.\nTransfer the plantains to a medium bowl and add the reserved cooking water, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mash the plantains to the consistency of mashed potatoes.\nIn a medium frying pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Drain the red onions and discard the vinegar. Add the onions to the pan and cook, stirring often, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.\nIn the same pan (no need to wipe clean), heat the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) olive oil over medium heat. Carefully crack the eggs into the pan, leaving space between each egg. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the whites are cooked and no longer translucent and the yolks are still runny. (I prefer the eggs over easy for this dish.)\nTo serve, divide the mashed plantain between plates and top with a fried egg, cooked onions, and a few slices of avocado. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
